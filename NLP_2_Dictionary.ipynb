         "END POVERTY\r\nIN ALL ITS FORMS \r\nEVERYWHERE\n\n22\r\nPoverty can be understood as a phenomenon that goes beyond monetary insu!ciency. A multidimensional \r\nconception of poverty takes into consideration minimum consumption of essential basic goods and \r\nservices “as part of the set of opportunities that any society should o\"er its members”. This set includes \r\naccess to basic levels of education, health, housing and other services (Gasparini, 2012).\r\nIn addition, the services that transform cities into opportunities and innovation hubs -such as sustainable \r\nmobility, formalization of employment and access to digital services, among others- require a \r\ncomprehensive approach to ensure the sustainable development of the most vulnerable communities.\r\nThe pandemic caused by COVID-19 exposed the inequality gaps that still persist in our cities, and the need \r\nto continue the processes of social and urban integration of low-income neighborhoods. In Buenos Aires \r\nCity, 97.29% of households have access to basic services (INDEC, 2010), including waste collection and \r\npublic transportation services, phone service, the presence of storm drains or sewers, pavement, public \r\nlighting, electricity supply, access to clean fuel for cooking and water supply.\r\nNevertheless, as mentioned above, a sustainable approach to these issues requires going beyond \r\ninfrastructural solutions and including a holistic perspective that cuts across the 2030 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda and involves the active participation of residents of low-income neighborhoods.\r\nThere are 57 low-income neighborhoods in the city, home to 73,673 families.\r\nPRIORITIZED TARGETS\r\n1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, \r\nhave equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership \r\nand control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, \r\nappropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance\n\n23\r\nThe integration of the Barrio 31 neighborhood and the promotion of equal opportunities\r\nIntegration within Buenos Aires City implies: the improvement and construction of housing and \r\ninfrastructure, the economic development of the neighborhoods, the promotion of employment, the \r\nrelocation and construction of educational and health centers, the enhancement and construction of \r\npublic spaces, and the development of infrastructure for mobility and connection with the rest of the city.\r\nIn the last five years, the Buenos Aires City Government has transformed Barrio 31 through the construction \r\nand improvement of housing, the creation of parks and squares, the provision of public transportation \r\n(with three bus lines), the construction and operation of three new health centers and two educational \r\ncenters, and the construction of the new Ministry of Education in the neighborhood.\r\nThus, more than 1,000 families were relocated to new homes and the City Government began the \r\nprocess of regularization of their property titles deeds as well as the connection to basic services: water, \r\ngas and electricit\r\nLINKING CITIES 2021\r\nIn May 2021, UNESCO awarded Buenos Aires City for its urbanization and integration process in the \r\nBarrio 31 neighborhood, with the Linking Cities 2021 recognition. \r\nThe results of the project include more than 1,000 new homes and the improvement of existing \r\nhomes, the construction of more than 17,000 linear meters of infrastructure and new public spaces, \r\nschools and health centers. In addition, 970 families living under the Illia Highway were relocated to \r\nnew housing, and, once the resettlement process has finished, this area under the highway will be \r\ntransformed into a new public space that will connect all sectors of the neighborhood.\r\nThe project also includes the promotion of the neighborhood economy and support for entrepreneurs.\n\n24\r\n• 12.000 families with new or improved housing (2023)\r\nIntegration policies in the face of COVID-19\r\nOne of the great challenges at the beginning of the pandemic to combat the virus in low-income \r\nneighborhoods was to immediately deploy new strategies to deal with the emergency. To this end, the \r\nBuenos Aires City Government acted jointly with the social organizations of each neighborhood and the \r\nNational Ministry of Health. \r\nPart of this work was possible thanks to the progress made by the local government in infrastructure in \r\nprevious years, for instance: the opening of streets in low-income neighborhoods to allow emergency \r\nservices to have access to them, and the construction of health centers.\r\n• 180.000 people with urban infrastructure and public services (2023)\r\nThe first Operation DetectAr in the country was launched in the Barrio 31 neighborhood for the screening, \r\ntesting and isolation of positive cases. In less than a month, the infection curve was reversed. Then, the \r\noperation was extended to other 28 points of the City, including the neighborhoods 1.11.14, 21.24, 15, 20, \r\nRodrigo Bueno and Carrillo.\r\nIn the same way, an operation was launched to accompany the homeless population: Buenos Aires \r\nPresente (“Buenos Aires is present”), a program that seeks to assist people and families in a condition \r\nof social risk. This involves people with violated rights and, in general, the homeless population in need \r\nof guidance, information and advice on social services. Within this framework, the City opened Social \r\nInclusion Centers, where people in vulnerable situations could spend the isolation period.\r\nEducational and economic development promotion policies\r\nThe fundamental tool to achieve inclusion throughout Buenos Aires City is education. According to the \r\nUnited Nations, the closure of schools due to the health crisis a\"ected 1.6 billion students, of which \r\n24 million could drop out of school (UN, 2020). In this regard, Buenos Aires is strongly committed to \r\ncontinuing face-to-face classes in the 2021 school year and to leave no student behind.\r\nRegarding class attendance and policies to reverse the increase in dropouts, the City identified 6,500 \r\nprimary school children who dropped out of school and 9,000 secondary school children who did not \r\nachieve the expected learning. In this sense, the education strategy has a double objective: on the one \r\nhand, to ensure students’ access and attendance to school and, on the other hand, to guarantee quality \r\nlearning that will provide them with long-term tools.\r\nESCUELA ABIERTA (OPEN SCHOOL)\r\nIt is a meeting place for children, families and the school community that seeks to strengthen \r\nschool trajectories in order to contribute to the development of learning and cultivate citizenship \r\nvalues through cultural, artistic, sports and recreational activities.\r\n It is aimed at children from kindergarten, primary and secondary school, taking into account the \r\ncurricular designs in force for each level.\n\n25\r\nFinally, another essential component for achieving sustainable social and urban integration is economic \r\ndevelopment. The head of government pledged to promote labor formalization and to support \r\nentrepreneurs as a key strategy for integrating the economy and the growth of low-income neighborhoods \r\nwith the rest of the city.\r\n• 75.000 workers in the people-based economy \r\nwith access to financing, training and formalization (2023)\r\nIn 2020, the Buenos Aires legislature passed the Law for the Promotion of the Social and People￾based Economy, which allows strengthening and encouraging the productive value of workers in low￾income neighborhoods. The regulation implies a progress towards the expansion of the network of formal \r\nbusinesses and the creation of formal production spaces, with the necessary qualifications for the safety \r\nof workers, and towards the economic development of all citizens, regardless of their neighborhood of \r\nresidence. \r\nThe law includes a system for access to credit, participation in public procurement and certain tax benefits, \r\nimpacting 500,000 people who used to work in the informal sector.\r\nFOOD COURTYARD IN THE RODRIGO BUENO NEIGHBORHOOD\r\nThe social and urban integration of neighborhoods implies the analysis of their economic potential \r\nand productive identity.\r\nThe Food Courtyard in the Rodrigo Bueno Neighborhood, which is part of the tourism strategy “BA \r\nCapital Gastronómica” (“BA Gastronomic Capital”), seeks to welcome citizens and visitors to the \r\nCity and promote the main activity of the neighborhood’s residents. The containers, transformed into \r\nfood and beverage stalls, are served by both neighborhood residents and private stakeholders who \r\ndecided to invest in the new space.\n\n26\r\nAnother initiative under the umbrella of promoting entrepreneurship and vocational training is the Center \r\nfor Entrepreneurial and Labor Development of Barrio 31 (CeDEL, for its initials in Spanish): a space that \r\ncentralizes economic integration policies and has classrooms, o!ces and a help desk, so that neighbors \r\ncan approach and receive advice, learn about formal job o\"ers, take employment guidance workshops \r\nand entrepreneurship training. In this way, the aim is to help them strengthen their business model. CeDEL \r\nis a versatile social and economic integration initiative that can be replicated in other neighborhoods and \r\ncontexts, and aims to be a link between the community, job o\"ers and the private sector.\n\n27\r\nCITY INDICATORS FOR MONITORING THE SDG TARGETS\r\nThe following is a selection of the indicators defined for monitoring SDG 1. The complete list can be found \r\nin the Annex to this document.\r\nTARGET 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have \r\nequal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land \r\nand other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial \r\nservices, including microfinance",

En la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, el 97.29% de los hogares tiene acceso a servicios básicos (INDEC, \r\n2010), entre los que se incluyen los servicios de recolección de residuos y de transporte público, telefo￾nía, la presencia de bocas de tormenta o alcantarillas, de pavimento, alumbrado público, la tenencia de \r\nelectricidad por red, el acceso a combustibles limpios para cocción y la provisión y procedencia del agua.\r\nSin embargo, y como se mencionó, el abordaje sostenible a estas cuestiones requiere ir más allá de las \r\nsoluciones infraestructurales e incluir una perspectiva holística que transversaliza la Agenda 2030 para el \r\nDesarrollo Sostenible, y que implica la participación activa de vecinos y vecinas de los barrios populares.\r\nEn la Ciudad los barrios populares albergan a 73.673 familias.\r\nMETAS PRIORIZADAS\r\n1.4 Para 2030, garantizar que todos los hombres y mujeres, en particular los pobres y \r\nlos más vulnerables, tengan los mismos derechos a los recursos económicos, así como \r\nacceso a los servicios básicos, la propiedad y el control de las tierras y otros bienes, la \r\nherencia, los recursos naturales, las nuevas tecnologías y los servicios económicos, in￾cluida la microfinanciación.\n\n23\r\nLa integración del Barrio 31 y promoción de igualdad de oportunidades\r\nIntegrar en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires implica: la mejora y construcción de viviendas e infraestructura, el \r\ndesarrollo económico de los barrios, la promoción del empleo, la reubicación y construcción de centros \r\neducativos y de salud, la puesta en valor y construcción de espacios públicos, y el desarrollo de infraes￾tructura para la movilidad y conexión con el resto de la ciudad.\r\nEn los últimos cinco años, el Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires transformó el Barrio 31 a partir de la \r\nconstrucción y mejora de viviendas; creación de parques y plazas; habilitación para el ingreso del trans￾porte público -con tres líneas de colectivos-; construcción, puesta en funcionamiento de tres nuevos \r\ncentros de salud y dos polos educativos; por último, la construcción del nuevo Ministerio de Educación \r\nen el barrio.\r\nAsí, más de 1.000 familias se reubicaron en nuevas viviendas e iniciaron los procesos de regularización \r\ndominial para contar con su título de propiedad y conexión a servicios básicos: agua, gas y electricidad.\r\nLINKING CITIES 2021\r\nEn mayo de 2021, la UNESCO premió a la Ciudad de Buenos Aires por su proceso de urbanización e \r\nintegración del Barrio 31, con el reconocimiento Linking Cities 2021. \r\nLos resultados del proyecto incluyen más de 1.000 viviendas nuevas y el mejoramiento de viviendas \r\nexistentes, la construcción de más de 17.000 metros lineales de infraestructura y de nuevos espacios \r\npúblicos, nuevas escuelas y centros de salud. Además, 970 familias que vivían debajo de la Autopista \r\nIllia se reubicaron en nuevas viviendas, que al finalizar el proceso de reasentamiento será un nuevo \r\nespacio público que conectará a todos los sectores del barrio.\r\nEl proyecto, a su vez, contempla la promoción de la economía barrial y el acompañamiento a em￾prendedores y emprendedoras.\n\n24\r\n• 12.000 familias con vivienda nueva o mejorada (2023)\r\nPolíticas de integración frente al COVID-19\r\nUno de los grandes desafíos al inicio de la pandemia para combatir el virus en los barrios populares, fue \r\ndesplegar de manera inmediata nuevas estrategias abocadas a la emergencia. Para ello, el Gobierno de la \r\nCiudad de Buenos Aires actuó en conjunto con las organizaciones sociales de cada barrio y el Ministerio \r\nde Salud de la Nación. \r\nParte de este trabajo fue posible gracias a los avances que el gobierno local había realizado en infraes￾tructura años anteriores, por ejemplo: la apertura de calles en barrios populares para permitir el paso de \r\nservicios de emergencia y la construcción de centros de salud.\r\n• 180.000 personas con infraestructura urbana y servicios públicos (2023)\r\nEn el Barrio 31 se puso en marcha el primer Operativo DetectAr del país para el rastreo, testeo y aisla￾miento de casos positivos. En menos de un mes se logró revertir la curva de contagios. Luego, se exten￾dió el operativo a otros 28 puntos de la Ciudad, incluyendo los barrios 1.11.14, 21.24, 15, 20, Rodrigo Bueno \r\ny Carrillo.\r\nDe la misma manera, se puso en marcha un operativo para acompañar a personas en situación de calle: \r\nBuenos Aires Presente, un programa que busca atender a personas y familias en condición de riesgo \r\nsocial. Esto implica personas con derechos vulnerados y, en general, a población en situación de calle con \r\nnecesidad de orientación, información y asesoramiento sobre servicios sociales. En este marco, la Ciudad \r\npuso a disposición Centros de Inclusión Social para que las personas en situación de vulnerabilidad pu￾dieran pasar el período de aislamiento.\r\nPolíticas educativas y de promoción del desarrollo económico\r\nLa herramienta fundamental para lograr la inclusión en toda la Ciudad de Buenos Aires es la educación. \r\nSegún las Naciones Unidas, el cierre de escuelas por la crisis sanitaria afectó a 1.600 millones de estudian￾tes, de los cuales 24 millones podrían abandonar las aulas (ONU, 2020). En este sentido, Buenos Aires \r\nestá fuertemente comprometida en continuar con las clases presenciales en el ciclo lectivo 2021 y en no \r\ndejar a ningún estudiante atrás.\r\nCon respecto a la asistencia a clases y a las políticas para revertir el aumento del abandono de estas, la \r\nCiudad identificó a 6.500 chicos de primaria que dejaron sus estudios y a 9.000 del nivel secundario \r\nque no alcanzaron los aprendizajes esperados. En este sentido, la estrategia frente a la educación tiene \r\nun doble objetivo: asegurar el acceso y asistencia de los estudiantes a la escuela por un lado y, por el otro, \r\ngarantizar un aprendizaje de calidad que le brinde herramientas a largo plazo.\r\nESCUELA ABIERTA\r\nEs un espacio de encuentro entre chicos/as, familias y la comunidad de la escuela que busca forta￾lecer las trayectorias escolares para contribuir al desarrollo del aprendizaje y cultivar valores ciuda￾danos por medio de actividades culturales, artísticas, deportivas y recreativas.\r\nEstá destinado a niños y niñas de nivel inicial, primario y jóvenes del nivel secundario, teniendo en \r\ncuenta los diseños curriculares vigentes para cada nivel.\n\n25\r\nPor último, otro de los componentes esenciales para lograr una integración social y urbana sostenible, \r\nes el desarrollo económico. El jefe de gobierno se comprometió a impulsar la formalización laboral y a \r\nacompañar a emprendedores y emprendedoras, como estrategia clave para integrar la economía y el \r\ncrecimiento de los barrios populares al resto de la ciudad.\r\n• 75.000 trabajadores de la economía popular con acceso a \r\n financiamiento, capacitación y formalización (2023)\r\nEn 2020, la legislatura porteña sancionó la Ley de Impulso a la Economía Social y Popular que permite \r\npotenciar e incentivar el valor productivo de las trabajadoras y trabajadores de los barrios populares. La \r\nnormativa es un avance hacia la ampliación de la red de comercios formales y la creación de espacios \r\nde producción formales, con las habilitaciones necesarias para la seguridad de los trabajadores y traba￾jadoras, y hacia el desarrollo económico de todos los vecinos y vecinas, independientemente del barrio \r\nde residencia. \r\nLa ley supone un sistema de acceso a créditos, la participación en compras públicas y ciertos beneficios \r\nimpositivos, impactando en 500.000 personas que trabajaban en la informalidad.\r\nPATIO GASTRONÓMICO EN EL BARRIO RODRIGO BUENO\r\nLa integración social y urbana de los barrios implica el análisis de su potencial económico e identi￾dad productiva.\r\nEl Patio Gastronómico del Barrio Rodrigo Bueno, que se enmarca en la estrategia turística de BA \r\nCapital Gastronómica, busca recibir vecinos, vecinas y visitantes de la Ciudad y promover la princi￾pal actividad de los residentes del barrio. Los contenedores, transformados en puestos de comida y \r\nbebida, son atendidos tanto por habitantes del barrio, como por inversores privados que decidieron \r\napostar por el nuevo espacio.\n\n26\r\nOtra de las iniciativas bajo el paraguas del fomento del emprendedurismo y la formación profesional, es el \r\nCentro de Desarrollo Emprendedor y Laboral del Barrio 31 (CeDEL): un espacio que centraliza las polí￾ticas de integración económica y que cuenta con aulas, oficinas y un espacio de atención al público, para \r\nque vecinos y vecinas puedan acercarse, recibir asesoramiento, conocer las ofertas de empleo formal, \r\ntomar talleres de orientación laboral y capacitaciones de emprendedurismo. De esta manera, se pretende \r\ncolaborar para que fortalezcan su modelo de negocios. El CeDEL es una iniciativa de integración social \r\ny económica versátil, que puede ser replicada en otros barrios y contextos, y que apunta a ser un nexo \r\nentre la comunidad, las ofertas de empleo y el sector privado.\n\n27\r\nINDICADORES DE LA CIUDAD PARA EL MONITOREO DE LAS METAS ODS\r\nA continuación, se presenta una selección de los indicadores definidos para el monitoreo del ODS 1. El \r\nlistado completo se encuentra en el Anexo del presente documento.\r\nMETA 1.4 Para 2030, garantizar que todos los hombres y mujeres, en particular los pobres y los más \r\nvulnerables, tengan los mismos derechos a los recursos económicos, así como acceso a los servicios \r\nbásicos, la propiedad y el control de las tierras y otros bienes, la herencia, los recursos naturales, las \r\nnuevas tecnologías y los servicios económicos, incluida la microfinanciación.",

         "End poverty in all its \r\nforms everywhere\r\nSDG 1\n\n22\r\nSDG 1 NO POVERTY\r\nPRIORITIZED TARGET\r\n1.4 Access to basic services\r\nAccess to basic services is understood as part of people’s right to satisfy \r\ntheir vital needs. In Buenos Aires City, 97.29% of households have access \r\nto basic services (INDEC, 2010), including waste collection and public \r\ntransportation services, telephony, the presence of rainwater drains or \r\nsewers, pavement, public lighting, access to the electrical grid, to clean \r\nfuel for cooking and water supply.\r\nFor more than a decade, Buenos Aires City Government has been working \r\nto achieve the social and urban integration of low-income neighborhoods \r\nbased on a comprehensive perspective.\n\n23\r\nIn this sense, the work approach was divided into three central areas: \r\n1. Housing, \r\n2. Urban and \r\n3. Socioeconomic Integration.\r\nHousing Solutions and Improvements\r\nThe frst area implies that each family lives in decent housing with access \r\nto all basic services. To this end, infrastructure and service works were \r\ncarried out for all housing units.\r\nWithin this framework, the City proposed to strengthen and deepen the \r\nintegration process of the low-income districts. In the neighborhoods \r\nBarrio Mugica, Barrio 20, Rodrigo Bueno, Camino de Sirga, Ricciardelli, 21-\r\n24 and Barrio 15, new houses were built, and existing ones were refurbished \r\nto provide families with a safe place to live. Thus, the commitment to \r\nbring urban infrastructure and public services to 80,000 inhabitants in \r\nlow-income districts was fulflled. Subsequently, this commitment was \r\nextended to 180,000 residents, of whom we have already reached more \r\nthan 131,400.\r\nTo achieve this goal, we used a holistic approach of social, urban, and \r\neconomic integration from within the neighborhood to the rest of the city. \r\nThus, we sought to equalize rights and responsibilities with the inhabitants \r\nof the neighborhood and continued working to reach the goal of 180,000 \r\nintegrated people. The process was participatory in nature, as it included \r\nmeetings with the residents in which the design was agreed upon according \r\nto their needs.\r\nIn line with the Housing Improvement Program, the sub-program Manos a la \r\nObra (Let’s do it) was created to ensure that all dwellings are safe, accessible, \r\nSDG 1 NO POVERTY\n\n24\r\nand adequate. In these cases, residents carry out the improvement works \r\nwith their own hands, while the government is responsible for monitoring \r\nthe work and for the progressive material provision. \r\nThanks to this urbanization and integration initiative that connects the joint \r\nwork between the City and its inhabitants, Barrio Mugica was granted an \r\naward in Poland at the World Urban Forum for its innovative, inclusive and \r\nsustainable approach. \r\nAll these works are essential for Barrio Mugica to have access to utilities so \r\nthat its residents can have the same standard of service as any other citizen \r\nof Buenos Aires City, with the corresponding payment responsibilities that \r\nthis entails.\r\nFor its part, intervention for socio-urban integration in Barrio Rodrigo \r\nBueno also achieved excellent results and improved the quality of life of \r\nthe City’s residents. In this way, quality, comprehensive, affordable, and \r\nsustainable housing solutions were promoted, enhancing the productive \r\nactivity of the neighborhood. \r\nFinally, in Barrio Fraga an urbanization process was carried out, with the \r\nconstruction of 678 new housing units distributed in 4 building blocks \r\nthat are divided into condominiums. In addition, another 230 families in \r\nthe neighborhood had their homes refurbished with new electricity, gas, \r\nand water supply connections. Other works included: 11 new streets, docks, \r\npublic spaces refurbishment, LED lighting, construction of rainwater drains, \r\nsewers, ramps, signage, and 17,350 meters of laid infrastructure pipes. \r\nToday, 100% of the neighborhood has a formal address.\r\nUrban Transformation \r\nThe second area involves connecting the neighborhoods to the rest of \r\nthe City. In Barrio Mugica we reached 17 km of infrastructure, revamped 19 \r\npre-existing public spaces, and created 15 new ones; public transportation \r\nstarted running again in the area and we installed many of the frst formal \r\nhome connections for electricity and water supply. \r\nIn addition, in the process of government decentralization, the Ministry of \r\nEducation was relocated to Barrio Mugica, where the María Elena Walsh \r\nEducation Center was built. Along the same line, the Ministry of Human \r\nDevelopment and Habitat was established in Barrio 15, in the building \r\nknown as “Elefante Blanco” (White Elephant), which was refurbished and \r\nrevamped, since it had been abandoned in the 1920s.\r\nLikewise, a new waste collection and urban sanitation system is being \r\nimplemented, while paving, sewage, rainwater, lighting, and electrical \r\nworks are being carried out.\r\nSDG 1 NO POVERTY\n\n25\r\nSDG 1 NO POVERTY\r\nSocial and Economic Development\r\nIn accordance with the idea of bringing neighborhoods closer to the \r\nCity, the third area consists of strengthening the productive activity in \r\neach neighborhood, respecting its identity, training its residents, and \r\npromoting work.\r\nConsidering this context, the City promoted the Law for the Promotion \r\nof Social Economy and the Law for Productive Integration. Therefore, it \r\nseeks to promote local development, the creation and sustainability of \r\nself-managed jobs, and access to new markets for productive units. It also \r\nfacilitates tools aimed at improving the production and commercialization \r\nof goods and services, with the purpose of reducing the economic and \r\nsocial gaps among citizens.\r\nIn addition, to promote the economic inclusion of its inhabitants, in Barrio \r\nRodrigo Bueno new ventures such as the “Patio Gastronómico” (Food \r\nCourtyard) and 57 new premises for local stores were opened, and the \r\n“Vivera Orgánica” (Organic Vegetable Garden) was encouraged. Finally, \r\nan Environmental Health Board was made based on the interest of the \r\nresidents in order to promote, discuss and propose environmental initiatives.\r\nOn the other hand, we promoted the Fair for Entrepreneurs in Barrio \r\nFraga (Chacarita Fair) and created the Single Registry of Productive \r\nUnits of the Popular and Social Economy (RUPEPyS, for its acronym in \r\nSpanish).\r\nFinally, in line with the educational and economic development promotion \r\npolicies, courses and entrepreneurship training were delivered. In addition, \r\neducational practices were offered, in which at least 450 students undergo \r\npedagogical experiences in areas related to their educational orientation \r\nor training path.\r\nIn addition, with the Youth Employment Plan, 10,000 residents between \r\nWORK IS THE BEST SOCIAL POLICY\r\nAt Buenos Aires City Government, we are convinced that work is the \r\nbest social policy. \r\nThis is why we are working to facilitate access to funding, training, \r\nand the formalization of 75,000 workers of the popular economy in \r\nthe City. \r\nWe also pledged that, by 2023 40 new companies will be established \r\nin Barrio Mugica to create new jobs and enhance the productive value \r\nand economic development of the neighborhood.\r\nWe encourage this policy by granting several benefts and providing \r\nsupport from the City. Each new company that settles in the area \r\nimplies that more people are working, consuming, and invigorating the \r\neconomy of Barrio Mugica.\n\n26\r\nSDG 1 NO POVERTY\r\n18 and 24 years of age will be inserted into the labor market, since this age \r\ngroup experiences the greatest diffculties in accessing a job. The aim is to \r\nprovide more and better opportunities and reduce the unemployment rate.\r\nCENTER FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL AND LABOR \r\nDEVELOPMENT FOR BARRIO MUGICA (CEDEL, FOR ITS \r\nACRONYM IN SPANISH)\r\nCeDEL is a public building in Barrio Mugica aimed at promoting \r\nthe economic development of its residents. It offers trades training, \r\npersonalized advice to entrepreneurs and a Job Bank that provides \r\nmore opportunities for accessing a formally registered job, by means \r\nof a Labor Integration Program.\r\n• 3,588 people registered in the Job Bank \r\n• 296 residents obtained job interviews with companies\r\n• 1,712 hired people\r\n• 5,721 residents graduated from courses and 311 are \r\nundergoing training\r\n• 659 residents were assisted in their entrepreneurial path",

En la Ciudad de Buenos \r\nAires, el 97.29% de los hogares tiene acceso a servicios básicos (INDEC, \r\n2010), entre los que se incluyen los servicios de recolección de residuos \r\ny de transporte público, telefonía, la presencia de bocas de tormenta o \r\nalcantarillas, de pavimento, alumbrado público, la tenencia de electricidad \r\npor red, el acceso a combustibles limpios para cocción y la provisión y \r\nprocedencia del agua.\r\nDesde hace más de una década, en el Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos \r\nAires trabajamos para lograr la integración social y urbana de barrios \r\npopulares desde una perspectiva integral.\n\n23\r\nEn este sentido, el enfoque de trabajo hacia la integración urbana, \r\neconómica y social se dividió en tres ejes centrales: \r\n1. Habitacional, \r\n2. Urbano y \r\n3. Socioeconómico.\r\nSoluciones y mejoras habitacionales\r\nEl primer eje implica que cada familia viva en una vivienda digna con \r\nacceso a todos los servicios básicos. Para ello se realizaron obras de \r\ninfraestructura y de servicios para todas las viviendas.\r\nDentro de este marco, la Ciudad se propuso fortalecer y ahondar en el \r\nproceso de integración de los barrios populares. En el Barrio Mugica, en el \r\nBarrio 20, en Rodrigo Bueno, en el Camino de Sirga, en el Barrio Ricciardelli, \r\n21-24 y en el Barrio 15 se construyeron casas nuevas y se reacondicionaron \r\nlas existentes para que las familias tengan un lugar seguro para vivir. Así, \r\nse cumplió con el compromiso de llevar infraestructura urbana y servicios \r\npúblicos a 80.000 personas de barrios populares. Luego, se extendió este \r\ncompromiso a 180.000 vecinos y vecinas, de los cuales ya alcanzamos a \r\nmás de 131.400.\r\nPara alcanzar este logro utilizamos un enfoque holístico, de integración \r\nsocial, urbana y económica desde el barrio hacia el resto de la Ciudad. \r\nAsí, se buscó igualar derechos y responsabilidades con los habitantes \r\ndel barrio, y se continuó trabajando para alcanzar el objetivo de 180.000 \r\npersonas integradas. El proceso fue de carácter participativo, ya que \r\nincluyó reuniones con los vecinos en las que se logró consensuar el diseño \r\nde acuerdo a sus necesidades.\r\nEn línea con el Programa de Mejoramiento de Vivienda, para que todas \r\nODS 1: FIN DE LA POBREZA\n\n24\r\nlas viviendas sean seguras, accesibles y adecuadas, se creó el subplan \r\nManos a la Obra. En estos casos, los vecinos y vecinas realizan las obras \r\nde mejoramiento con sus propias manos, mientras que el seguimiento de \r\nla obra y la provisión progresiva de materiales queda a cargo del gobierno. \r\nGracias a esta iniciativa de urbanización e integración que vincula el \r\ntrabajo en conjunto entre la Ciudad y sus habitantes, el Barrio Mugica fue \r\npremiado en Polonia durante el World Urban Forum por tomar un enfoque \r\ninnovador, inclusivo y sustentable. \r\nTodas estas obras resultan fundamentales para que el Barrio Mugica tenga \r\nacceso a los servicios públicos y, así, sus vecinos y vecinas puedan contar \r\ncon el mismo estándar de servicio que cualquier otro porteño, con las \r\nresponsabilidades de pago que eso conlleva. \r\nPor su parte, la intervención para la integración socio-urbana en el Barrio \r\nRodrigo Bueno, también alcanzó excelentes resultados y mejora en la \r\ncalidad de vida los vecinos y vecinas de la Ciudad. De esta manera, se \r\npromovieron soluciones habitacionales de calidad, integrales, asequibles y \r\nsostenibles, potenciando la actividad productiva del barrio. \r\nFinalmente, en el Barrio Fraga, se llevó a cabo un proceso de urbanización, \r\ncon la construcción de 678 viviendas nuevas distribuidas en 4 bloques de \r\nedifcios divididos en consorcios. Además, a otras 230 familias del barrio \r\nse les remodeló sus hogares con instalaciones nuevas de luz, gas y agua. \r\nEntre otras obras, en el barrio se realizaron 11 aperturas de calles, dársenas, \r\nrenovación del espacio público, alumbrado LED, construcción de pluviales \r\ny bocas de tormenta, cloacas, rampas, señalética y se han tendido 17.350 \r\nmetros de caños de infraestructura. \r\nHoy, el 100% del barrio posee dirección formal.\r\nTransformación urbana\r\nEl segundo eje involucra la conexión de los barrios con el resto de la \r\nCiudad. En el Barrio Mugica alcanzamos los 17 km de infraestructura en \r\ntodo el barrio, pusimos en valor 19 espacios públicos preexistentes y 15 \r\nfueron creados, volvió a circular el transporte público e instalamos muchas \r\nde las primeras conexiones domiciliarias formales de agua y de electricidad. \r\nAdemás, en el proceso de descentralización del gobierno, se trasladó el \r\nedifcio del Ministerio de Educación al Barrio Mugica, como también se \r\nconstruyó el Polo Educativo María Elena Walsh. En esta línea es que se \r\ninstaló el Ministerio de Desarrollo Humano y Hábitat en el Barrio 15, en \r\nel edifcio conocido como “Elefante Blanco”, el cual fue reacondicionado \r\ny puesto en valor, debido a que el mismo se encontraba en situación de \r\nabandono desde los años 20´.\r\nAsimismo, se está implementando un nuevo sistema de recolección de \r\nODS 1: FIN DE LA POBREZA\n\n25\r\nODS 1: FIN DE LA POBREZA\r\nbasura e higiene urbana, y realizando obras de pavimentación, cloacas, \r\npluviales, iluminación e instalación eléctrica.\r\nDesarrollo social y económico\r\nPor último, y en concordancia con el acercamiento del barrio a la Ciudad, \r\nel tercer eje consiste en potenciar la actividad productiva de cada barrio, \r\nrespetando su identidad, mediante la capacitación de vecinos y vecinas o \r\nla promoción del trabajo.\r\nConsiderando este contexto, es que la Ciudad impulsó la Ley de Promoción \r\na la Economía Social y la de Integración Productiva. De esta manera, \r\nse busca promover el desarrollo local, la generación y sostenibilidad de \r\npuestos de trabajo autogestivos y el acceso a nuevos mercados de las \r\nunidades productivas. Como también facilitar herramientas destinadas \r\na mejorar la producción y comercialización de los bienes y servicios, \r\ncon vistas a disminuir las brechas económicas y sociales entre las y los \r\nciudadanos.\r\nAdemás, a fn de propiciar la inclusión económica de sus pobladores, en \r\nel Barrio Rodrigo Bueno, se iniciaron también nuevos emprendimientos \r\ncomo el Patio Gastronómico y 57 nuevos locales para comercios barriales, \r\ny se potenció la huerta “Vivera Orgánica”. Finalmente, fue conformada \r\nuna Mesa de Salud Ambiental a partir del interés de los propios habitantes, \r\npara promover, discutir y proponer iniciativas ambientales. \r\nEL TRABAJO ES LA MEJOR POLÍTICA SOCIAL\r\nEn el Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, estamos convencidos de \r\nque el trabajo es la mejor política social. \r\nPor eso, trabajamos para facilitar el acceso a fnanciamiento, \r\ncapacitación y formalización para 75.000 trabajadores y trabajadoras \r\nde la economía popular en la Ciudad. \r\nY, nos comprometimos a que, para 2023, 40 nuevas empresas se \r\nradiquen en el Barrio Mugica, con el objetivo de generar nuevas fuentes \r\nde empleo y potenciar el valor productivo y el desarrollo económico \r\ndel barrio.\r\nIncentivamos esta política mediante el otorgamiento de diversos \r\nbenefcios y el acompañamiento de la Ciudad. Cada nueva empresa que \r\nse radica en la zona signifca más personas trabajando, consumiendo y \r\ndinamizando la economía del Barrio Mugica.\r\nPor otro lado, impulsamos la Feria de Emprendedores en el Barrio Fraga \r\n(Feria Chacarita) y se creó el Registro Único de Unidades Productivas de \r\nla Economía Popular y Social (RUPEPyS). \r\nFinalmente, en línea con las políticas educativas y de promoción del \r\ndesarrollo económico, se dictaron cursos y brindaron capacitaciones de \r\nemprendedurismo. Como también se ofrecieron prácticas educativas en \n\n26\r\nODS 1: FIN DE LA POBREZA\r\nlas que al menos 450 estudiantes desarrollan experiencias pedagógicas en \r\námbitos vinculados con la orientación o trayecto formativo que transitan. \r\nAdemás, con el Plan Empleo Jóven, 10.000 vecinos y vecinas de entre 18 \r\ny 24 años se insertarán en el mundo laboral a través de la contratación \r\nde este grupo que enfrenta las mayores difcultades para acceder a un \r\ntrabajo. De esta manera, se busca brindar más y mejores oportunidades y \r\ndisminuir la tasa de desempleo.\r\nCENTRO DE DESARROLLO EMPRENDEDOR Y LABORAL \r\nDEL BARRIO MUGICA (CEDEL)\r\nEl CeDEL es un edifcio público dentro del Barrio Mugica destinado \r\na potenciar el desarrollo económico de los vecinos. Allí se ofrecen \r\ncapacitaciones en ofcios, asesoramiento personalizado a los \r\nemprendedores y hay una bolsa de empleo que, a través de un \r\nPrograma de Integración Laboral, acerca más oportunidades de \r\nacceder a un trabajo en blanco.\r\n• 3588 personas se inscribieron en la Bolsa de Empleo, \r\n• 296 vecinos consiguieron entrevistas con empresas\r\n• 1712 fueron contratados. \r\n• 5721 vecinos se graduaron de cursos, y 311 se están capacitando\r\n• Acompañamos a 659 vecinos en su camino emprendedor.",

         "15\r\nWith regard to this SDG in particular, it is understood within a framework of \r\nprofound integrality with the rest of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\noriented towards people. In this sense, the actions and strategies identified for \r\nthe subsequent SDGs, i.e., SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10, are also understood as actions \r\nthat directly contribute to the reduction of multidimensional poverty, \r\nunderstood not only in terms of the income that people receive, but also as the \r\naccumulation of various deprivations, which together or individually, prevent \r\nthem from leading a full life. Thus, the actions listed under SDG 1 must \r\nnecessarily be read as fundamental to address them, but they are \r\ncomplemented by the actions of SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10.\r\nActions aimed at providing housing solutions\r\nWith regard to the provincial programs developed to address multidimensional poverty, the housing\r\ndimension stands out, which involves increasing access to housing and promoting good housing for the \r\ncitizens of the Province. Within this framework, the Ministry for the Promotion of Employment and Family \r\nEconomy is the main governmental actor in charge of these objectives. \r\nIn this sense, the housing strategy of the Province seeks to respond to the provisions of Article 58 of the \r\nProvincial Constitution of Córdoba, in reference to \"Housing\", which states that \"all inhabitants have the \r\nright to enjoy decent housing, which, together with the related services and the land necessary for its \r\nsetlement, has a fundamental social value\". In this way, the single dwelling is immune to seizure, under the \r\nconditions established by law. \r\nTo this end, the Government of the Province of Córdoba promotes the necessary conditions to make this \r\nright efective. To this end, it plans and implements the current housing policy, acts to coordinate with \r\nother jurisdictional levels and relevant social institutions specific actions to achieve this objective.\r\nIt is important to note that the housing policy of the Province of Córdoba is governed by the following\r\nprinciples:\r\n1. To use land rationally and preserve the quality of life, in accordance with the general interest \r\nand the cultural and regional paterns of the community.\r\n2. To prevent speculation.\r\n3. To assist families without resources in order to facilitate their access to home ownership.\r\nAt the same time, the provincial housing policy seeks to provide a solution to what was detected in the \r\nstatistical studies carried out by the Government of the Province with the 2008 Population Census, which \r\nshows that many families with structural housing problems, such as overcrowding, lack of access to \r\nhousing, lack of urbanization, etc., are unable to reverse this situation by their own means.\r\nAmong the main programs that respond to the housing policy of the Province of Córdoba are the \r\nfollowing:\r\nVoluntary Local Review CÓRDOBA 2022 | Province of Córdoba | ARG.\n\nTransport benefits to provide equality of opportunities\r\nThe Department of Transport of the Province of Córdoba seeks to develop transport policies that seek to \r\nrespond to this multidimensional view of poverty. In this sense, two main strategies are developed: on the \r\none hand, one oriented to the demand of transport, and on the other hand, one oriented to the supply of \r\ntransport. \r\nWith respect to the strategy focused on the demand that citizens make for transport services, the first \r\nstep is to clearly identify the target population, i.e., which sectors require greater accessibility to public \r\ntransport. Thus, one of the axes of this demand is aimed at strengthening access to transport for students \r\nin the Province of Córdoba. To this end, the Free Educational Ticket program is being implemented, seeking\r\nto ensure that the school population has the tools to participate in schools, and that transport is not a\r\n16\r\nDIGNIFIED LIFE PROGRAM\r\nThis program provides families \r\nin Córdoba with a financial \r\ncontribution to enable them to \r\nrefurbish their homes and thus \r\nimprove their quality of life. This \r\ninitiative is from the Ministry of \r\nEmployment Promotion and \r\nFamily Economy and has 14,000 \r\nbeneficiaries for the year 2021.\r\nOWNER PROGRAM\r\nAllocation of plots with \r\ninfrastructure (water, energy, \r\nlighting and curbs and guters) \r\nto families residing in the \r\nprovince with demonstrable \r\nincome and without title to \r\nplots or homes. This program is \r\nan initiative of the Ministry of \r\nPublic Works in coordination \r\nwith the Ministry of \r\nEmployment Promotion and \r\nFamily Economy, which implied \r\nthe delivery of 1,400 lots by \r\n2021.\r\nSEED HOUSING PROGRAM\r\nThis program seeks to reduce \r\nthe housing deficit in the \r\nvulnerable population and \r\nconsists of the delivery of \r\nmaterials for the construction of \r\nhousing modules. Each one has \r\n36.2 square meters of covered \r\nsurface area organized into a\r\nkitchen-dining room, bedroom, \r\nbathroom and a design that can \r\nbe extended in the future. It is \r\nan initiative of the Ministry of \r\nEmployment Promotion and \r\nFamily Economy. In 2021, 1,056 \r\nkits of construction materials \r\nwere delivered. It should be \r\nnoted that at the beginning of \r\n2022, the Province launched the \r\n10,000 Homes program, an \r\ninitiative that will provide \r\nhousing solutions to families in \r\nCórdoba, through two zero-rate \r\nmortgage loans. The first line \r\nbelongs to Seed Housing\r\nscheme (6,500 beneficiaries) \r\nand is intended for the \r\nconstruction of a single, \r\npermanent home. The second \r\nline (3,500 beneficiaries) is \r\naimed at the purchase or \r\nconstruction of housing, \r\nfinanced by Córdoba Bank.\r\nYOUR HOUSE, YOUR TITLE DEED \r\nPROGRAM\r\nThis initiative seeks to provide \r\nlegal security of ownership of \r\nreal estate to vulnerable groups \r\nwho do not own another home \r\nand do not have the resources \r\nto pay for the process. In total, \r\n6,076 deeds were processed \r\nthrough this initiative.\r\nBENEFITS ON UTILITY BILLS\r\nReductions in electricity and \r\nwater services and in the \r\nprovincial property tax for the \r\nmost vulnerable families in the \r\nprovince of Córdoba. The benefit \r\nis extended to pensioners' \r\ncenters, neighborhood centers \r\nand non-profit organizations \r\nthat work with socially \r\nvulnerable members of the \r\ncommunity. It is an action of the \r\nMinistry of Social Development \r\nthat will reach 260,000 \r\nbeneficiaries by 2021.\r\nlimitation for people to be able to study at any level: preschool, primary, secondary and university. In \r\naddition, other plans are implemented to respond to the demand of certain population groups that need \r\nthis support, such as the Social Bus Tickets for Factory Workers, for people who - although they are \r\nemployed - earn less than two minimum wages, in order to achieve a higher income for these workers \r\nthrough this transport benefit. Similarly, there is also Córdoba Social Ticket for people in precarious \r\nsituations. \r\nIn relation to the strategy focused on the supply of transport, where the approach is more global, fare \r\ncompensations are carried out within the public transport of passengers that include both urban \r\ntransport, which covers the city limits of a city, and interurban transport, which connects the \r\nmunicipalities of the Province. The objective of this second strategy seeks to atenuate the cost that the \r\nuser has to confront of the total fare, reason why part of this cost is aforded by the governments in its \r\nthree levels, national, provincial and municipal, who work in an articulated manner. In this way, by \r\nmitigating this cost, transport accessibility is extended to all citizens and productive mobility is also \r\npromoted. \r\nFinally, it is important to highlight the way in which these strategies are implemented. In the case of the \r\ndemand-oriented strategy, the aim is to correctly identify the citizens who need these programs. For \r\nexample, in relation to the Free Educational Ticket, we work together with the educational management \r\nsystems of state-run and private schools, as well as with university systems. In addition, web-based \r\nstudent registration is implemented, which facilitates access and minimizes processing time. In relation to \r\nthe implementation of the supply-side strategy, regulatory cost analyses are carried out, and the \r\nproportions of fees to be provided by the state are identified.\r\nThe main programs that respond to the transport policy of the Province of Córdoba include the following:\r\nVoluntary Local Review CÓRDOBA 2022 | Province of Córdoba | ARG.\n\nTransport benefits to provide equality of opportunities\r\nThe Department of Transport of the Province of Córdoba seeks to develop transport policies that seek to \r\nrespond to this multidimensional view of poverty.

En ese sentido, las acciones y estrategias identificadas \r\npara los ODS consiguientes, es decir para los ODS 2, 3, 4, 5 y 10 también se \r\nentienden como acciones que aportan de manera directa a la reducción de una\r\npobreza multidimensional, comprendida no sólo en términos de los ingresos que \r\nperciben las personas, sino asimismo como la acumulación de diversas carencias, \r\nque en su conjunto o de manera individual, impiden a las mismas el desarrollo de \r\nuna vida plena. Así, debe leerse las acciones listadas bajo este ODS 1 \r\nnecesariamente como fundamentales para su abordaje, pero que se completan \r\ncon las aquellas acciones propias de los ODS 2, 3, 4, 5 y 10.\r\nAcciones orientadas a dar soluciones habitacionales \r\nRespecto a los programas provinciales desarrollados para dar respuesta a la pobreza que se comprende \r\nmultidimensional, se destaca la dimensión habitacional, la cual implica profundizar el acceso a la vivienda\r\ny promover el buen habitar de las y los ciudadanos de la Provincia. En este marco, el Ministerio de \r\nPromoción del Empleo y de la Economía Familiar es el principal actor gubernamental encargado de estos \r\nobjetivos. \r\nEn ese sentido, la estrategia habitacional de la Provincia busca dar respuesta a lo establecido en la\r\nConstitución Provincial de Córdoba en su art 58, en referencia a “La Vivienda”, el cual sostiene que “todos \r\nlos habitantes tienen derecho a disfrutar de una vivienda digna, la que, junto a los servicios con ella\r\nconexos y la tierra necesaria para su asentamiento, tiene un valor social fundamental”. De esa manera, la\r\nvivienda única es inembargable, en las condiciones que fija la ley. \r\nPara ello, el Gobierno de la Provincia de Córdoba promueve las condiciones necesarias para hacer efectivo \r\neste derecho. A tal fin, planifica y ejecuta la política de vivienda actual, actúa para concertar junto a los \r\ndemás niveles jurisdiccionales e instituciones sociales pertinentes acciones específicas para alcanzar este \r\nobjetivo. \r\nEs importante remarcar que la política habitacional de la Provincia de Córdoba se rige bajo los siguientes \r\nprincipios:\r\n1. Usar racionalmente el suelo y preservar la calidad de vida, de acuerdo con el interés general y \r\nlas pautas culturales y regionales de la comunidad.\r\n2. Impedir la especulación.\r\n3. Asistir a las familias sin recursos para facilitar su acceso a la vivienda propia.\r\nAl mismo tiempo, la política habitacional provincial busca dar solución a lo detectado en los estudios \r\nestadísticos realizados por el Gobierno de la Provincia con la realización del Censo Poblacional del año \r\n2008, donde se muestra que numerosas familias con problemas estructurales de vivienda, tales como \r\nsituaciones de hacinamiento, el no acceso a la vivienda propia, la falta de urbanización etc, sin posibilidades \r\nde revertir dicha situación por sus propios medios.\r\nEntre los principales programas que dan respuesta a la política habitacional de la Provincia de Córdoba\r\nencontramos los siguientes:\n\nBeneficios de transporte para igualar oportunidades\r\nDesde la Secretaría de Transporte de la Provincia de Córdoba se busca desarrollar políticas de transporte \r\nque busquen dar respuesta a esta mirada multidimensional que se tiene de la pobreza.

Este programa\r\nes una iniciativa del Ministerio \r\nde Obras Públicas en articulación \r\ncon el Ministerio de Promoción \r\ndel Empleo y Economía Familiar, \r\nel cual implicó para el año 2021, \r\nla entrega de 1.400 lotes.\r\nVIVIENDA SEMILLA\r\nBusca reducir el déficit \r\nhabitacional en la población \r\nvulnerable y consiste en la\r\nentrega de materiales para la\r\nedificación de módulos \r\nhabitacionales.

Es una\r\niniciativa del Ministerio de \r\nPromoción del Empleo y \r\nEconomía Familiar. En el año \r\n2021 se entregaron 1.056 kits de \r\nmateriales de construcción. Se \r\ndestaca que a comienzos del año \r\n2022 la Provincia lanzó el \r\nprograma 10 mil Viviendas, una\r\niniciativa que brindará\r\nsoluciones habitacionales a\r\nfamilias cordobesas, a través de \r\ndos créditos hipotecarios a tasa\r\ncero. La primera línea pertenece \r\na Vivienda Semilla (6.500 \r\noportunidades) y está destinada\r\na la construcción de una\r\nvivienda única y permanente.

De igual manera, también se encuentra el Boleto Social Cordobés \r\ndestinado a personas en situación de precariedad. \r\nEn relación a la estrategia enfocada a la oferta de transporte, donde el abordaje es más global, se llevan a\r\ncabo compensaciones tarifarias dentro del transporte público de pasajeros que incluyen tanto a los \r\nurbanos, que recorren el ejido de una ciudad, e interurbanos, que conectan los municipios de la Provincia. \r\nEl objetivo de esta segunda estrategia busca atenuar el costo que tiene que afrontar el usuario del pasaje \r\ntotal, por lo que parte de dicho costo es solventado por los gobiernos en sus tres niveles, nacional, \r\nprovincial y municipal, quienes trabajan articuladamente. De esa manera, al atenuarse ese costo, permite \r\nque se amplíe la accesibilidad del transporte a toda la ciudadanía y se fomenta de igual modo la movilidad \r\nproductiva. \r\nFinalmente, es importante remarcar la manera en cómo se implementan estas estrategias. En el caso de \r\naquella orientada a la demanda, se busca hacer una correcta identificación de los ciudadanos que \r\nnecesitan de estos programas. Por ejemplo, en relación con el Boleto Educativo Gratuito se trabaja en \r\nconjunto con los sistemas de gestión educativos de escuelas públicas y privadas, así como con los sistemas \r\nde las universidades. Además, se implementa la inscripción web de los alumnos, lo cual facilita el acceso y \r\nminimiza el tiempo del trámite.

El mismo está destinado a proyectos productivos \r\nque se encuentren en funcionamiento y que hayan sido afectados por las \r\ncomplicaciones económicas devenidas por la pandemia y requieran de un \r\nimpulso para la reactivación. Durante el 2021 se asistieron 340 unidades \r\nproductivas. \r\n \r\n1.3. Poner en práctica a nivel nacional sistemas y medidas apropiadas de \r\nprotección social para todos y, para 2030, lograr una amplia cobertura de los \r\npobres y los más vulnerables.\r\nDISPOSITIVO MÓVIL A TU PUERTA\r\nEste programa, acompaña a vecinos y vecinas, en situación de vulnerabili￾dad social que por alguna imposibilidad física, simbólica, geográfica, no \r\npuede acercarse a ningún centro para recibir atención. El dispositivo cuenta \r\ncon un equipo interdisciplinario de psicólogos, trabajadores sociales y enfer￾meros, quienes acompañan en domicilio a las personas, tendiendo a recons￾truir el lazo social y restituyendo sus derechos. El mismo funciona de lunes a \r\nlunes y acompaña a 200 grupos familiares.\r\n1.4. Para 2030, garantizar que todos los hombres y mujeres, en particular \r\nlos pobres y los más vulnerables, tengan los mismos derechos a los recur￾sos económicos, así como acceso a los servicios básicos, la propiedad y el \r\ncontrol de las tierras y otros bienes, la herencia, los recursos naturales, las \r\nnuevas tecnologías y los servicios económicos, incluida la microfinanciación.\r\nPROGRAMA JUNTO A VOS\r\n \r\nEste programa acompaña a las familias de mayor vulnerabilidad social a \r\ntravés de una ayuda económica, que se entrega en los Centros de Atención \r\nPrimaria de la Salud (CAPS), buscando que los grupos familiares se referen￾cien con el espacio, obteniendo un abordaje integral. En contraprestación el \r\ntitular asiste a los talleres o encuentros realizados durante el año tendientes a \n\n10\r\nfortalecer y a generar autovalimiento. En el año 2020, 400 grupos familiares \r\nque no se encontraban alcanzados por las políticas públicas nacionales resul￾taron beneficiarios. \r\n \r\nPROGRAMA NACIONAL \r\nACCIONAR AYUDAS URGENTES\r\n A través de la Secretaría de Desarrollo Social de la municipalidad de La \r\nCosta se logró realizar una articulación con el Consejo Nacional de Coordina￾ción de Políticas Sociales, desde donde se realizan distintas acciones, una de \r\nellas tiene que ver con la línea de AYUDAS URGENTES. Este programa busca \r\natender situaciones de extrema vulnerabilidad que necesiten atención inme￾diata y no puedan aguardar los tiempos administrativos regulares del Estado, \r\npara paliarlas con el otorgamiento de un subsidio económico. A través de la \r\narticulación de la Municipalidad de La Costa, se logró acordar la implementa￾ción del programa para 100 familias.",

         "22 melbourne.vic.gov.au\r\nContext\r\nPoverty is a complex issue everywhere. The likelihood \r\nof experiencing and overcoming poverty is influenced \r\nby interdependent factors such as access to work and \r\nafordable community services, and income, education, \r\nhousing, health and inclusion. It is disproportionately \r\nexperienced in Australia by Aboriginal and Torres Strait \r\nIslander peoples, young people and children, older people, \r\nwomen, single parents, people with a disability and \r\nmigrants. This means that achieving many other Goals also \r\nrelies on reducing poverty, such as: Goal 2 – No Hunger, \r\nGoal 3 – Good Health and Wellbeing, Goal 4 – Quality \r\nEducation, Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth, \r\nGoal 10 – Reduced Inequalities, and Goal 11 – Sustainable \r\nCities and Communities.\r\nThere is no nationally agreed definition of poverty in \r\nAustralia. We adopt the OECD definition of the poverty \r\nline as half the median household income of the total \r\npopulation, this translates to a single adult living on less \r\nthan $426.30 a week. For a couple with two children, \r\nit is $895.22 a week.\r\nCOVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability we face when \r\na crisis occurs. The interconnected nature of existing \r\nchronic stresses, overlaid with an acute shock, can have \r\ndisproportionate impact. We have witnessed challenges \r\nwith access to food, housing afordability, job losses \r\nand reduced wages. \r\nCity of Melbourne is responsible for providing programs \r\nthat alleviate the lived experience of poverty for community \r\nmembers, as opposed to specifically reducing poverty. As \r\nthe home of Melbourne’s central business district, we also \r\nhave a unique role to play in supporting economic activity \r\nvia services and infrastructure, fostering the creation of \r\ndecent, sustainable jobs, as well as advocating to other \r\nlevels of government on behalf of the community. \r\nBy 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages \r\nliving in poverty within the City of Melbourne in all its dimensions according to national \r\ndefinitions (SDG target 1.2)\r\nImplement nationally and locally appropriate social protection systems, services and measures \r\nfor all and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable (SDG target 1.3)\r\nBy 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular people experiencing socioeconomic \r\ndisadvantage and vulnerability, have equal rights to economic resources and housing, including \r\naccess to basic and financial services (SDG target 1.4)\r\nBy 2030, build the resilience of people in the City of Melbourne experiencing socioeconomic \r\ndisadvantage and in vulnerable situations, and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to \r\nclimate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and \r\ndisasters (SDG target 1.5, see also SDG target 11.5)\r\nProgress snapshot\r\nThe proportion of the population living in poverty fell from 9.1 per cent to 7.4 per cent between 2015 and 2019. Income \r\ninequality slightly worsened between 2015 and 2018 in comparison to the metropolitan Melbourne average.\r\nTargets \n\nFigure 2: Proportion of the population living below the national \r\npoverty line (i.e. living on less than 50% of Australian median income)\r\nFigure 4: People living in poverty\r\nFigure 3: Gini Coefcient in 2018\r\n(relative income inequality - where 0 is perfect income equality and \r\n1 is perfect inequality)\r\nKey performance indicators\r\nCity of Melbourne Voluntary Local Review 2022 23\r\n0\r\n10\r\n15\r\n5\r\n20\r\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\r\n9%\r\n11%\r\n7% 7%\r\nGreater\r\nMetropolitan\r\nMelbourne \r\n0.48 \r\nCity \r\nof \r\nMelbourne\r\n0.56\r\n0 1\r\n11%\r\n9%in Greater \r\nMetropolitan 7% Melbourne\r\nin the \r\nCity of \r\nMelbourne\r\nApproximately \r\npeople living \r\nin poverty\r\nin 2019 13,200\n\n24 melbourne.vic.gov.au\r\nHow we are delivering on this goal\r\nWe have a range of programs to address afordable housing \r\nand homelessness, jobs, food security, mental wellbeing, \r\ninclusion, reconciliation and community infrastructure and \r\nservices. The progress and impact of these programs is \r\ncaptured in other Goals. All play a critical role in reducing \r\nthe risk factors for poverty within our community. However, \r\nwe need to improve our understanding of who and where \r\nvulnerable people are and take more concerted steps to \r\ntarget poverty. \r\nOur Council Plan includes the following priorities over the \r\nnext four years:\r\n• Fair, appropriate and accessible afordable housing \r\nis available for people of all backgrounds, with special \r\nfocus on people experiencing homelessness (see also \r\nGoal 11). \r\n• Increased economic participation, with a city economy \r\nthat is fairer and more inclusive, enabling access to \r\nemployment for residents and access to accommodation \r\nfor key workers in the municipality (see Goal 8).\r\n• Food security increases for everyone, especially the most \r\nvulnerable (see also Goal 2). \r\n• Core services are accessible and afordable for everyone, \r\nwith special attention given to mental health, lifelong \r\neducation and internet services (see also Goal 3 and \r\nGoal 4). \r\n• City of Melbourne activities – including events, the arts \r\nand culture – are accessible and afordable for everyone \r\n(see also Goal 8). \r\nWe will collaborate with the community using a \r\nplace-based approach to ensure we tap into the knowledge \r\nand experiences in our diverse communities. Over time, \r\nCity of Melbourne will develop insights from each \r\nneighbourhood to help us understand the impacts of \r\nlong-term planning and investment decisions. Through this \r\napproach, we will gain insight into poverty in our community \r\nand be able to target our eforts and investment towards \r\nthe population groups and neighbourhoods that are \r\nexperiencing the greatest inequalities. \r\nResponding to COVID-19 through \r\nour community services\r\nSince COVID-19, people in our community have \r\nexperienced issues with family life, mental health, \r\nsocial isolation, education, and changes to plans \r\nand usual activities. City of Melbourne responded \r\nby enhancing service delivery to provide additional \r\nsupport to vulnerable groups:\r\n• 2,200 meals delivered to families in need\r\n• 30,000 masks delivered to the community\r\n• 200 play and art packs delivered to children in \r\nhousing estates\r\n• 57 projects for disadvantaged communities \r\nfunded by coronavirus emergency \r\nresponse grants\r\n• Family violence support worker available for \r\nface-to-face support\r\n• 731 care packs delivered to young people\r\n• 5,000 wellbeing phone calls and 230 online \r\nprograms for older adults and carers\r\n• Online and phone support for families with \r\nchildren aged 0-4 years of age\r\nSee also Goal 2 ‘Our Shout’ food voucher program.\n\nCity of Melbourne Voluntary Local Review 2022 25\r\nThrough delivery of City of Melbourne programs and services, \r\nwe expect to see improvements in the lives of people experiencing \r\npoverty. To achieve the no poverty targets in our communities, we \r\nneed to further build relationships with all levels of government, \r\nthe private sector and community organisations to collectively \r\nunderstand and tackle the underlying causes of poverty.\n\n26 melbourne.vic.gov.au\r\nOur key strategies and plans \r\nCouncil Plan strategic objective: Access \r\nand afordability; Economy of the future \r\nCommunity Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment Framework\r\nCommunity Food Relief 2021 – 2025: \r\nPlanning for a food secure city\r\nDisability Access and Inclusion Plan 2020-2024\r\nEconomic Development Strategy 2031\r\nHealth and Wellbeing Plan \r\n(integrated in the Council Plan)\r\nAfordable Housing Strategy 2020-30\r\nInclusive Melbourne Strategy 2021-31\r\nReconciliation Action Plan 2021-23\r\nFood insecurity Employment Inequalities Housing and resilience\r\nRelated indicators across other Goals\r\nData coverage\r\nIncome alone does not represent the complexity of factors \r\nthat afect poverty, but it does allow for measurement over \r\ntime and comparison with other cities.

         "20\r\nSDG 1 – End poverty in all its forms everywhere\r\nThis SDG is primarily aimed at eradicating all forms of extreme poverty. The poverty \r\nrate should be halved by 2030. We therefore discuss the risk of poverty in this \r\nchapter. This involves the development of strong social protection systems and \r\naccess to basic services and economic resources. Reducing poverty goes hand in \r\nhand with ensuring equal rights and covers every aspect of life. In addition, we \r\nfocus on increasing the resilience of people in vulnerable situations and on limiting \r\nthe impact of economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters, especially \r\nfor those in vulnerable situations. \r\nThe 2020-2025 multi-annual strategic plan of Ghent includes the following related \r\nobjectives: \r\n‘Reducing poverty in Ghent by pursuing a proactive and integral anti-poverty policy’ \r\nthrough: \r\n> Assisting homeless people with a view to re-integration\r\n> Reinforcing and aligning the anti-poverty policy across all policy areas and \r\nraising awareness about poverty \r\n> Providing appropriate assistance to all families with underage children as well as \r\nall young people living in poverty \r\n> Providing integral personalised assistance to people in vulnerable situations and \r\nwith growing problems\r\n> Ensuring that people can meet their basic needs and assert their essential rights\r\nSDG 1 in short\r\nFurther information: the official text of the SDGs \r\ndrawn up by the United Nations is included as an \r\nannex. Below you can find the list of underlying \r\ntopics. \r\nExtreme poverty (1.1)\r\nRisk of poverty (1.2)\r\nSocial protection systems (1.3)\r\nEqual rights (1.4)\r\nResilience (1.5)\r\nUnequal impact of extreme events (1.5) \r\nTopics of SDG 1\n\n21\r\nSDG 1 – END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nStatus of the city\r\nExtreme poverty (1.1)\r\nThis objective is less relevant to Ghent (the poverty threshold is 1.25 US dollar a day).\r\nRisk of poverty (1.2)\r\nAccording to the European poverty threshold, people who earn less than 60% of the \r\nnational median income have an increased poverty risk. This is called ‘monetary or \r\nfinancial poverty’. However, poverty is not just a question of income. “People living in \r\npoverty are unable to bridge this gap on their own. Poverty and social exclusion can \r\nbe both the cause and the outcome of insufficient access to income, employment, \r\neducation, healthcare, housing and participation in society.”3\r\n The number of \r\nGhentians living in financial poverty is calculated on the basis of the poverty risk. \r\nTo do so, we apply the Belgian indicators to the situation in Ghent. In an urban \r\ncontext, any Belgian figures are always an underestimation of the real situation. \r\nThe risk of poverty among the Belgian population is 16.4%:4\r\n this means that 16.4% \r\nof Belgians have an income which is less than 60% of the national median income. \r\nIf we apply this percentage to Ghent, the total number of people at risk of poverty \r\namounts to 42,500. In the context of Belgium, the risk of poverty and social exclusion \r\nis estimated at 20%, which corresponds to approximately 52,000 Ghentians. \r\nAlthough these two percentages have remained relatively stable over the past few \r\nyears, the risk of poverty was at its highest level in the final year of the monitoring \r\nperiod (2018). We have also observed another evolution: the risk of poverty is \r\nincreasing among young people and decreasing among older people. \r\nAt the Belgian level, the risk of financial poverty is higher for children and young \r\npeople than for adults: 17.8% versus 15.5%. It may be inferred that 8,823 children are \r\nliving in financial poverty in Ghent and that 10,706 children (21.6% of all 0-17 year \r\nolds) are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.5\n\n22\r\nSDG 1 – END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nThe family characteristics are relevant in this respect:6\r\n17% of the children live in a family where at least one parent does not work; this can \r\nbe broken down into:\r\n > 39% living in a single-parent family where the parent does not work\r\n > 9% living in a two-parent family where both parents do not work \r\nThe risk of poverty differs depending on the individual’s age, background and \r\ntype of family as well as their employment status and ownership situation. In this \r\nreport, we only describe the differences based on demographic characteristics. \r\nThe risk of poverty is one and a half times higher for single people. The risk of \r\npoverty is two to three times higher for single parents. \r\nThe risk of poverty is three times higher for people born outside Belgium than \r\nfor people born in Belgium. The risk of poverty can be broken down further by \r\ngroups of the population:\r\n > The risk of poverty for people born outside the EU-28: 46.3%\r\n > The risk of poverty for people born in the EU (excluding Belgium): 19.4%\r\n > The risk of poverty for people born in Belgium: 11.5%7\r\nThe risk of poverty increases for older people as well: 16.6%. An estimated total \r\nof 7,200 Ghentians over 65 years of age are at risk of poverty. \r\nChild poverty\r\nChild poverty is measured on the basis of the social deprivation index of the \r\nBelgian Child and Family Agency. This indicator takes into account the complexity of \r\npoverty and the multitude of interconnected forms of exclusion in various areas of \r\nindividual and social life. It monitors the birth rate in vulnerable households. In 2019, \r\nthis rate was 22.0%,8which is higher than the Flemish average. It is estimated that \r\napproximately 10,000 of the 50,486 Ghent children (i.e. 19.9%) are living in poverty. \n\n23\r\nSDG 1 – END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nDifferences between Ghent neighbourhoods\r\nThere are major differences in terms of poverty between the Ghent \r\nneighbourhoods:\r\n > The level of social deprivation is highest in the neighbourhoods Nieuw Gent-UZ, \r\nMuide-Meulestede-Afrikalaan and Rabot-Blaisantvest. \r\n > They are followed by Brugse Poort-Rooigem and Sluizeken-Tolhuis-Ham. \r\n > The neighbourhoods Bloemekenswijk, Ledeberg and Watersportbaan-Ekkergem \r\nalso rank above the city’s average. \r\nAll figures point in the same direction: one in five Ghentians lives in a situation of \r\npoverty and social exclusion. \r\nIn addition, about 13% of Ghentians experience financial difficulties.9\r\nHomeless people and people with inadequate or insecure \r\naccommodation \r\nHomelessness and inadequate or insecure accommodation are extreme forms \r\nof poverty and social exclusion. \r\nOfficial figures on the number of homeless people and people with inadequate \r\nor insecure accommodation in Ghent are not available. Every year, the Public \r\nCentre for Social Welfare (PCSW) assists about 500 long-term (>3 months) Ghent \r\nhomeless people in finding a permanent residence. The majority (78%) are men, \r\nand 75% of them are facing multiple issues. The PCSW does not have any figures \r\non short-term/acute homelessness. There is a certain degree of mobility \r\nbetween cities and between a city and the surrounding rural municipalities. The \r\nCity of Ghent and various partners are currently (May 2020) preparing an official \r\npoint-in-time count. \r\nIn 2019, the centre for general welfare work CAW (Centrum Algemeen \r\nWelzijnswerk) of East Flanders provided assistance to 1,180 homeless people \r\nand people with inadequate or insecure accommodation (some without legal \r\nresidence and others with legal residence). Of these, 872 stayed in one of the \r\nGhent shelters: 51.2% men and 48.8% women, including 280 accompanying \r\nchildren. The CAW assisted 631 homeless people and people with inadequate \r\nor insecure accommodation, 52% of whom were men and 48% of whom were \r\nwomen, in finding a home. \n\n24\r\nSDG 1 – END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nSocial protection (1.3)\r\nPeople in need are entitled to additional social protection. In this report, we will \r\ndiscuss a few measures within the scope of poverty reduction. \r\nGhentians with insufficient or no income can receive a guaranteed minimum income, \r\nwhich is called “living wage” or “equivalent living wage”. 3% of all Ghentians, i.e. 7,774 \r\npeople in total, receive an (equivalent) “living wage”.10 Living wage recipients are also \r\nassisted in completing training and/or finding employment. \r\nTheir right to increased health insurance reimbursement ensures they have access \r\nto healthcare. We also use this indicator for mapping the risk of poverty (not \r\ncalculated at a local level). In 2009, 16.4% of the Ghent population was entitled to \r\nincreased health insurance reimbursement. This percentage increased to 18.5%11 in \r\n2014 and reached 20.2% in 2017. \r\nWe have observed that more than 1 in 4 inhabitants of Ghent over the age of 65 \r\nare entitled to increased health insurance reimbursement. 6.5% of people over 65 \r\nreceive a guaranteed income for the elderly (social welfare benefits for old-age \r\npensioners with insufficient financial means). Both figures have remained stable \r\nover the past few years. Financial vulnerability continues to be an important area of \r\nattention for the elderly as well.12\r\nOne in five Ghentians lives in a situation of poverty and social exclusion, and the \r\ncurrent “living wage” does not suffice to help people out of poverty.13 14\r\nEqual rights (1.4) \r\nPlease refer to SDG 5 ‘gender equality’ and SDG 10 ‘reduced inequalities’ for more \r\ninformation on this topic. \n\n25\r\nSDG 1 – END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nResilience (1.5)\r\nHelp provided by the PCSW \r\nEvery town or city in Belgium has a Public Centre for Social Welfare (PCSW) which \r\nis responsible for ensuring the welfare of all citizens. The PCSW is open to all \r\ninhabitants of Ghent. Everyone is entitled to adequate housing, healthcare, sufficient \r\nfinancial means, etc. The PCSW provides assistance in each one of these aspects and \r\ntherefore focuses on increasing the resilience of vulnerable Ghentians. \r\nIn 2019, the Ghent PCSW supported a total of 28,997 unique persons, i.e. 10.9% of the \r\nGhent population or 14,105 households. These persons / households could count on \r\nfinancial, administrative, psychological and legal assistance. In doing so, the PCSW \r\nreached out to approximately seven in ten people in financial poverty. \r\nUnequal impact of extreme events (1.5)\r\nSome people have less access to the social safety net because they are not \r\nofficially recognised as citizens (residing in Belgium). These are people without legal \r\nresidence, for instance refugees who did not come to Belgium through the regular \r\nsystem. Due to their vulnerable position, they require additional help, yet have no \r\nequivalent access to healthcare. \r\nPeople without legal residence \r\nGhent accommodates a significant number of people without legal residence, but \r\nexact figures are not available. The City of Ghent estimates that some 3,250 people \r\nwithout legal residence were present within its administrative boundaries op 1 \r\nJanuary 2019. (This figure is based on a study which combinated medical data, a \r\nlocal general survey and international literature research). Migrants in transit and \r\npeople with an uncertain residence status have not been included in this figure. We \r\nestimate the number of minors without legal residence to be 1,000. Overall, about \r\nhalf are EU citizens and about half are non-EU citizens.",

In this section, \r\ntherefore, we discuss the risk of poverty. \r\nReducing that risk involves building strong \r\nsocial protection systems, achieving equal \r\nrights and providing access to basic services \r\nand economic resources. Poverty reduction \r\nfocuses on all areas of life. In addition, we \r\nare dedicated to the resilience of people in \r\nvulnerable situations and to reducing the \r\nimpact of economic, social and environmental \r\ndisasters, especially for people in vulnerable \r\ncircumstances.\r\nSDG 1 in brief\r\nWe transferred the official sub-goals into topics for \r\neach SDG. You can also view the fully written sub￾goals here.\r\nExtreme poverty (1.1) \r\nRisk of poverty (1.2) \r\nSocial protection systems (1.3) \r\nEqual rights (1.4) \r\nResilience (1.5) \r\nUnequal impact of extreme events (1.5)\r\nSDG 1 topics \n\n16\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nThe City of Ghent’s strategy and approach\r\nCity of Ghent approach \r\nObviously, the projects in this report only provide a limited view of how the City \r\nof Ghent operates with respect to poverty. The City of Ghent and Public Centre for \r\nSocial Welfare Ghent are joining forces to help people living in poverty, based on \r\nthe vision that every Ghent citizen is entitled to a dignified life. Everyone should be \r\nable to take part in life in our city and that is why we are fighting poverty, helping \r\nthe people of Ghent to progress financially and to implement their social rights. We \r\nsupport them where necessary in all areas of life: living, working, education and \r\nlearning, health, energy, leisure, etc. We pay special attention to opportunities for \r\nchildren.\r\nThe major actions in the fight against poverty are bundled in the Ghent Poverty \r\nPolicy Plan. This plan is the result of close collaboration with numerous \r\norganisations fighting poverty. An annual report on what happened to implement the \r\nplan is submitted to the city council’s welfare committee.\r\nIf you would like to know more about the approach to poverty in Ghent, please go to \r\nthis link.\r\nStrategy\r\nIn the Ghent Multi-annual Strategic plan 20-25, we find the following \r\ngoals that contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals:\r\n‘Less poverty in Ghent through a proactive and integral poverty policy’:\r\n> Helping the homeless with their reintegration. \r\n> Strengthening the poverty policy in all policy areas and raising awareness about \r\npoverty. \r\n> All families with underage children and all young people living in poverty receive \r\nappropriate support.\r\n> Ensuring tailored integral assistance for the vulnerable population and its growing \r\nissues.\r\n> Ensuring that people can meet their basic needs and exhaust their most important \r\nrights.\n\n17\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nSDG 1 International\r\nInternational benchmark by OECD SDG Index6\r\nTo allow for an international comparison for SDG 1, ‘no poverty’, the OECD SDG Index\r\nsuggests the following indicator: the share of the population (in percentage) living \r\non a disposable income below the poverty line77\r\n. This corresponds with the AROP \r\nindicator88, the risk of monetary poverty. The data for this indicator in the SDG index \r\ndates back to 2016, but already gives an initial idea of where Ghent is positioned \r\ncompared to other cities with respect to this goal.\r\nThe SDG Index provides a score of 1-100, where a score of 100 is the indicator’s \r\nproposed fi nal value to achieve the target by 2030. \r\nGhent = ‘selected city’ \r\nSource: OECD9\r\n6 OECD: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\r\n7 The poverty line is equal to 60% of the national average disposable household income.\r\n8 STATBEL (s.d.).

(2020). Measuring the distance to the SDGs in regions and cities, consulted at https://www.oecd-local-sdgs.org/index.html.\r\nInternational Projects \r\nEvery year, the City of Ghent supports international projects with the ‘Ghent citizens \r\nwithout borders’ project subsidy. Several SDGs are at the centre of this. SDG 1, ‘no \r\npoverty’, is refl ected in several proposals and approved projects. However, we \r\nspecifi cally focus on the project ‘Africa in Flanders’, to set up vocational training for \r\nseamstresses and workshops on confl ict management in Congo. Job creation is one \r\nof the most successful ways to lift families out of poverty, especially when it comes \r\nto projects in diffi cult regions. In addition, Ghent signed the Eurocities pledge on \r\nhomelessness and is the leader of the Urbact project ROOF (‘housing fi rst’).\r\nImpact of the coronavirus crisis \r\nPoverty increases on many fronts\r\nAlthough poverty affects many areas, everything starts with a lack of fi nancial \r\nresources. Those who benefi t from a living wage often still live below the poverty \r\nline, because the federally determined living wage limits fall below it.\r\nSince Covid, the number of living wage recipients has been rising: in December 2019 \r\nthere were 5,035 living wage recipients, in December 2020 there were as many as \r\n5,471. The monthly fi gures also show that the downward trend until July 2019 has \r\nturned into an upward trend in 2020.\r\nFigure 1 OECD SDG-index – SDG 1\r\n Selected city Country average User selection Bottom 20% Top 20%\r\nValues\r\nEnd Value\r\nNO\r\nPOVERTY\r\nCities\r\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n18\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nFigure 2 Monthly figures number of living wage recipients \r\nIf we look beyond the living wage, but still limit ourselves to the possible types \r\nof help from the Social Services of the City of Ghent, it appears that the most \r\nvulnerable people still live in the 19th and 20th century belt.\r\n10 Steunpunt tot bestrijding van armoede, bestaansonzekerheid en sociale uitsluiting (2021).

Close cooperation between welfare and education provides an answer \r\nto the many questions parents or young people ask the schools. Parents often ask \r\nwelfare questions of schools, but they do not always find their way to the right \r\nwelfare partners. Within this accessible and proactive operation, we reach families \r\nthat we would otherwise not reach. \r\nWith Children First we cooperate with the schools in three ways: \r\n1. In schools with the most vulnerable population, there are open days. The social \r\nworkers are there at set times. \r\n2. In other schools we work with consultations: an appointment is made with the \r\nsocial worker at the school. \r\n3. Thirdly, there is a clear point of contact for all schools in Ghent. \r\nChildren First has the following goals:\r\n> Entitlements (e.g., application for a subsistence allowance, application for a \r\nmedical card, study grant, etc.).\r\n> To unburden schools, to raise awareness of poverty in schools and to provide \r\nsupport in their poverty policy (e.g., training). Better knowledge of deprivation, \r\nchild and generational poverty16 enables schools to create opportunities and \r\nsupport children and their families.\r\n> Guaranteeing appropriate assistance for each child/family: improving access to \r\nservices for people in poverty, with priority attention to parents, children and their \r\nfamilies; improving cooperation between the sectors/partners involved across life \r\ndomains. In this way, we bridge the gap between assistance, leisure and school.\r\n> Support families in the most vulnerable conditions by paying for school meals.\r\n16 By deprivation we mean the situation in which people are deprived of opportunities to participate adequately in socially valued goods: education, labour, housing. This is not a one-off event, but a lasting state of \r\naffairs that occurs in different areas - tangible and intangible. In the case of generational poverty, we see exclusion in a single family in successive generations, whether financial, social or other.\r\nIn practice\r\nChildren First’s social workers use the schools as a source. In schools with open \r\ndays, the social worker is available at school at a fixed time. Parents can drop by \r\nwithout an appointment. This is communicated to parents through leaflets and \r\nposters. The liaison officer, pupil guidance, the care team, the administration, the \r\nschool social worker will refer to Children First’s social worker. They will look at the \r\nfamily’s or young person’s question, what barriers to assistance there are, help with \r\nthe question itself or put the inquirer in touch with other services.\r\nIn schools where we have consultations, we work by appointment. The consultation \r\ntakes place at school or during a home visit. Other than that, everything else is like \r\nan open day. \r\nWe work in an approachable and proactive way and reach families we would \r\notherwise not reach. Schools primarily act as the referring party for children and \r\nfamilies. Because of their proximity and involvement, they are often the first point of \r\ncontact for parents. Therefore, they are a privileged partner. The close cooperation, \r\nconsultation and sharing of knowledge between the school team and the Children \r\nFirst staff ensure sustainable solutions: income (living wage, child benefits, \r\nunemployment benefits), material assistance (food parcels, emergency medical \r\ncare), administrative assistance, debt mediation, access to (mental) health care. \r\nChildren First also increases knowledge about poverty in schools, including through \r\nconsultations with teachers and through training. In this way, we create more \r\nopportunities to better support children in precarious situations.\n\n22\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nCollaboration in the city\r\nChildren First is an initiative of PCSF Ghent in conjunction with the Education Centre \r\nGhent. The following partners are critical to the operation:\r\n> The social workers at Children First with their head social worker, head of \r\ndepartment and the relevant psychologist from the Psychological Service of PCSF \r\nGhent make up the core team.\r\n> Ghent schools and their school teams (such as pupil guidance, care coordinator, \r\nschool social worker) are the central partners at Children First. \r\n> In addition to the members of the school team, the liaison officer between school, \r\nparents and neighbourhood is essential. A child has most opportunities if it can \r\ndevelop in a context where school, family and neighbourhood are partners in \r\ncreating a broad and challenging learning and living environment. Children and \r\nyoung people learn both inside and outside school walls/hours if all the learning \r\nprerequisites are satisfied. Think about housing, income, food, health, safety. \r\nEvolution\r\nIn 2015, PCSF Ghent and the House of the Child launched a pilot project in the \r\nprimary school De Toverberg. A social worker was available at the school twice a \r\nweek. This approach caught on. Parents found it easier to get help, and teachers and \r\nliaison workers also felt supported.\r\nThe pilot project was extended to five schools in the 2016-2017 school year. In 2017-\r\n2018, the operation became structural: from then on two social workers worked in \r\nquite a few schools with a fixed open day, including part-time and special education \r\nschools. In addition, they involved a consultation function in many schools. In \r\nthe school year 2020-2021, the team of social workers was doubled again. As of \r\nSeptember, the four social workers were able to work in nearly 35 open day schools \r\nand almost 40 other schools. Within the renewed operation of the welfare centres, \r\neach school can quickly and directly contact the social worker at the welfare office in \r\nthe neighbourhood in which the school is located. \r\nFor whom\r\nChildren First aims to reach all school-age children who grow up in vulnerable \r\nsituations (from toddler to adolescent) and their families. In Ghent, it is \r\nestimated that 1 child in 5 grows up in poverty. This means approx. 10,000 children. \r\nPoverty threatens children’s rights as they experience more stress and anxiety. Child \r\npoverty also increases the risk of poverty and social exclusion in adult life. Children \r\nFirst has a greater impact: we step in early and break through (generational) \r\npoverty. The presence of an PCSF staff member in the school takes into account \r\nthe SES (socio-economic status) of the pupils in the school. Children First is closest \r\nin schools with the highest SES rates, where the greatest number of children in \r\nvulnerable situations attend school. With the expansion of Children First, we are also \r\npresent in schools that are interested in helping to shape a poverty policy and, for \r\nexample, want to work on proactive rights.\r\nProud of\r\nA unique cross-domain cooperation takes place between education and welfare \r\nwithin the school. By being present at school we work better and in a more \r\nintegrated way and we bridge the gap between help and service, leisure time and \r\nschool.\r\nWe work in an approachable manner by transferring the PCSF services to the school. \r\nYoung people can be helped anonymously and personally in the school environment. \r\nWe provide administrative and financial support so that young people can focus on \r\nlearning. Support is also close at hand for parents and teachers. We catch questions \r\nand needs more quickly. And schools experience this as support for the complex \r\n(welfare) questions they are faced with.\r\nKeeping in touch with schools and liaison workers leads to a relationship of trust. \r\nThis is bearing fruit and leads to the effective granting of rights and support to \r\nfamilies and young people.\n\n23\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY EVERYWHERE AND IN ALL ITS FORMS\r\n‘After our assessments, it appears that most schools are enthusiastic about the Children \r\nKlaske, social worker: \r\n“\r\nFirst operation. Because we provide support on an administrative level and are well \r\nacquainted with the network of organisations in Ghent, we take over a workload from \r\nthe teachers, liaison workers, grade coaches and student counsellors. We refer people \r\nimmediately or find out what support is possible on an administrative, financial or \r\nemotional level. We have the knowledge to provide the necessary help.’\n\n24\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nAn additional bonus is the embedding in the bigger picture of our PCSW work: we \r\nexchange and share knowledge.\r\nResults\r\nThe Children First team doubled to four social workers in 2020. The number of \r\nschools with open days and consultations expanded to nearly 35 open day schools \r\nand almost 40 schools with consultations. In the 2019-2020 school year there were \r\n362 social workers for families or young people. Of this group, 64% did not receive \r\nsupport from PCSF Ghent at the time. Some 100 people received further guidance \r\nfrom a regular social worker at PCSF Ghent (e.g., for the allocation of the living wage, \r\nsocial guidance, debt assistance) and 93 families received a refund for school meals.\r\nLastly, we would like to point out that in spite of the coronavirus, the social workers \r\ncontinued to work in the schools, with an adjusted working method.\r\nAmbitions\r\nWe strive for the growing awareness of the topic of poverty and poverty policy in \r\nschools. We want to encourage schools to take a ‘poverty look’. We are collaborating \r\nwith Education Centre Ghent and are concentrating on cost-conscious education and \r\npoverty awareness training tailored to the needs of the schools.\r\nWe are reinforcing the link between welfare and education: together with Education \r\nCentre Ghent and TOPunt Ghent vzw, we are organising an exchange day: school \r\nteams, social workers and CLB staff meet at neighbourhood level and get to know \r\neach other’s work even better.\r\nWe are looking into how we can reach even more families and young people. \r\nThe Childcare Department (City of Ghent) shows interest in connecting childcare \r\ninitiatives with the work of social workers in the welfare offices. And we are looking \r\nat how this approach provides opportunities in other areas of life: for example, by \r\ndeploying social workers to sources in other sectors, such as material assistance \r\ninitiatives. \r\nWe aim to evolve further towards a more structural approach to school poverty, with \r\na strong poverty policy in the Ghent education system. Also in schools where there \r\nare currently no Children First social workers or liaison officers. \r\nIn the coming years, Education Centre Ghent will, together with PCSF Ghent, focus \r\neven more on poverty awareness and policy in schools. We are working on three \r\naspects: support for a more conscious poverty and cost policy at school; striving for \r\naffordable education in Ghent through lower and transparent school fees; reducing \r\nfinancial stress among parents and at school.\r\nBy joining forces, both in terms of education policy and poverty policy, we aim to \r\nremove (financial and other) barriers to education in Ghent. Pupils in poverty should \r\nhave the same opportunities as everyone else. The collaboration between Education \r\nCentre Ghent and the PCSF supports schools in forming a poverty-ready school \r\nteam and reducing financial stress for both school and parents. We are committed to \r\nlower, more transparent school fees. In addition, we are working to reduce the digital \r\ndivide. Over three years, actions will be taken by the e-inclusion working group \r\nDigitaal.Talent@Gent, Education Centre Ghent, Education Ghent and the various \r\neducation umbrella organisations.\r\nChallenges\r\nWe notice major differences between schools with respect to the awareness of \r\npoverty at school. \r\nChildren First cannot always immediately take care of the (distressing) requests \r\nfor help. In our city, too, there are waiting lists and we cannot always provide \r\nappropriate assistance.\r\nResources to support children and families in paying for school meals are limited. \r\nDemand exceeds supply. Although we aim to support as many children/young people \r\nas possible in the most vulnerable situations, some people/schools fall by the \r\nwayside. \n\n25\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nFinally, it is not easy to make a separate room available in some schools. This was \r\ncertainly the case during the coronavirus crisis. Social workers showed a lot of \r\ncreativity in continuing to reach out to families and young people. \r\n Role of the City of Ghent\r\nChildren First is part of PCSF Ghent’s operations. The social workers at Children First \r\nform a team within the PCSF. In addition, signals and findings from the Children First \r\nsocial workers are included and fed back to other City of Ghent departments through \r\nthe head social worker and the head of the department. Education Centre Ghent \r\ncooperates with the PCSF based on the supporting educational policy to give shape \r\nto the poverty policy at school. \r\n Importance of partnerships \r\nCooperation between different cities and at the Flemish level is appropriate for \r\ntaking sustainable steps in the area of affordable education and raising awareness \r\nabout poverty in education. Sharing knowledge and good examples will help us \r\nreach our goal of accessible Ghent education with sufficient bridges to welfare more \r\nquickly.\r\nWe have also noticed a great deal of interest in Children First from other cities \r\nand are keen to share knowledge with other cities in Flanders. Through platforms \r\nsuch as Eurocities (Workgroup Children and Young People), this is also happening \r\ninternationally. \r\n Further info\r\n> Info on Children First: https://stad.gent/nl/samenleven-welzijn-gezondheid/\r\nocmw-gent/gent-tegen-armoede/kinderarmoede/\r\nkinderen-eerst-welzijn-op-school\r\n> Info on Ghent’s poverty policy: https://stad.gent/nl/onderwijscentrum-gent/\r\narmoedebeleid\n\n26\r\nThe associations where people\r\nin poverty speak up\n\n27\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nThe associations where people in poverty speak up\r\n ,, ,\r\nIn the fi ght against poverty and social exclusion, the associations where people in \r\npoverty speak up are full partners. We give people with experience with poverty a \r\nvoice in policy. In addition, we create safe and energising meeting places for people \r\nwith and without experience with poverty. We make people stronger in the fi ght \r\nagainst poverty.\r\nWe noticed that a large heterogeneous group of people is living in poverty in cities. \r\nSome groups are diffi cult to reach. They include non-Dutch-speaking Ghent residents \r\nand single parents with young children. \r\nIn very concrete terms, we go the extra mile to reach a broader target group of \r\npeople living in poverty and to build and share knowledge and experience in the \r\narea of participation by people living in poverty.\r\nIn practice\r\nFirstly, the associations are actively working on broadening the target group. This \r\ncreates more diversity in the group. Together with the associations, we actively track \r\ndown under-reached groups, such as non-native speakers, single young parents, \r\nlonely elderly people, the homeless. And we motivate them to take part in the work \r\nof the associations. To this end, we establish links with civil society organisations \r\nwho are in contact with these groups.\r\nIn addition, we are committed to building and sharing expertise. To this end, we \r\nwork together with the Policy Participation Department of the City of Ghent. The \r\nthree associations act as the Ghent Collective against Poverty and represent a \r\nknowledge centre in the area of policy participation for people in poverty. With \r\n17 These are BMLIK, SIVI vzw and De Zuidpoort vzw\r\n18 vzw = non-profi t organisation\r\nthe establishment of the Collective, we build a bridge to the newly established \r\nParticipation Point of the City of Ghent (Policy Participation Department). This \r\nParticipation Point now represents the support for city services and employees, \r\nand also aims to focus more broadly on cooperation with citizens’ initiatives, \r\nassociations and businesses. In this respect, the acquired knowledge within the \r\nassociations adds considerable value.\r\nCollaboration in the city\r\nThe associations where people in poverty speak up17 are the project’s initiators, in \r\ncooperation with the City and PCSF Ghent. City services and other partners also \r\ncontribute to the project.\r\n> Movement for people with a low income and children vzw18 (BMLIK), SIVI vzw, \r\nDe Zuidpoort vzw, Jong Gent in Actie, KRAS Gent, Samenlevingsopbouw Gent.\r\n> City of Ghent services: Policy Support Staff of the Local Social Policy Department, \r\nPolicy Participation/Social Management Department, Housing Department, Urban \r\nRenewal Department, Cultural Affairs Department.\r\nEvolution\r\nThe associations where people in poverty speak up have been fi ghting poverty \r\nand social exclusion for a long time, together with people living in poverty. The \r\nMovement of People with Low Incomes and Children was founded in 1983. Vzw SIVI \r\nand vzw de Zuidpoort were founded in the mid-1990s.\r\nIn the meantime, the City and the PCSF have been collaborating for years with the \r\nassociations where people in poverty speak up. The associations can count on \r\nfi nancial support in this. In 2015, the associations concluded grant agreements with \r\nthe City, with a view to eventually concluding structural cooperation agreements in \r\nthe 2020-2025 policy period.\n\n28\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nIn these cooperation agreements (2020), we emphasise:\r\n> Broadening the target group, so that we speak on behalf of all persons living in \r\npoverty, irrespective of their origin.\r\n> Policy participation with and for people in poverty and development of expertise: \r\nover the years, we have acquired expertise in methodologies, in reaching out to \r\ngroups, and in specific topics that lead to greater participation in the policy by \r\npeople in poverty. This makes for a more efficient and qualitative policy dialogue. \r\nThis expertise is actively shared with the relevant city services (Social Services, \r\nPolicy Participation and any other services involved).\r\nFor whom\r\nPeople with experience with poverty who live and/or stay in Ghent. Special attention \r\nis paid to groups that the associations have had difficulty reaching so far, or have \r\nhad limited access to.\r\nProud of\r\nTogether with the city services, the associations ensure greater visibility of the \r\nknowledge and expertise of the associations, and, in particular, of people personally \r\nexperiencing poverty.\r\nThey focus more on joint expertise development, among others on creating more \r\nimpact, bringing more diversity to the voice of people in poverty, or attracting new \r\npeople in poverty to the operation. In short: innovate to achieve better results.\r\nThe associations found a good balance between standing up for and representing \r\npeople in poverty and their loyalty to the local policy (city and PCSF). They are \r\nclearly fighting a common battle against poverty and social exclusion. \r\nDuring the coronavirus crisis, we managed to continue to reach people in the target \r\ngroup. The circumstances were challenging, but by focusing more on an individual \r\napproach and working in very small groups, we were able to reach that very \r\nvulnerable group.\r\nSome examples of completed creative, innovative or surprising initiatives:\r\n> Best Citizen: A group of people living in poverty (De Zuidsprekers) developed a \r\n‘recipe book’ to make policy participation accessible to every citizen.\r\n> Within the framework of the neighbourhood budgets, the \r\nvzw SIVI listed the needs in the neighbourhood together with \r\nresidents and supported them in elaborating the ideas and \r\nshowing their projects in the neighbourhood. Using innovative \r\nmethods, we entered into a dialogue with other residents \r\nwith similar ideas, in order to potentially work together. These \r\nactions allowed people with experience with poverty to use \r\ntheir own resources and, as active citizens, to help determine \r\nthe future of the neighbourhood;\r\n> Since January 2020, the vzw SIVI has been holding ‘table \r\ndiscussions’ with people awaiting their turn in the food \r\ndistribution. Vzw SIVI translates their experiences and \r\nperceptions into signals for policy. \r\n> In the spring, two major projects were underway: housing \r\nand mobility. In mid-March, the coronavirus crisis threw a \r\nspanner in the works, eliminating the host’s meeting function. \r\nPublic consultations were temporarily suspended. During that period, issues were \r\nperceived that are related to the coronavirus crisis. As soon as safety measures \r\nallowed, the table discussions were worked out in a corona-proof environment \r\n(mid-May 2020). These topics were dealt with in 2020: waste and cleanliness, \r\nhousing, poverty, coronavirus crisis, a second project on mobility, digitalisation, \r\nemergency aid, tap water and leisure time. In 2020, SIVI conducted a total of 318 \r\ntable discussions.\n\n29\r\nSDG 1: END POVERTY EVERYWHERE AND IN ALL ITS FORMS\r\nAnn, coordinator of vzw SIVI: \r\n‘Being part of the creation of projects such as Dampoort knapT OP and seeing the project \r\ngrow gives me an incredible sense of satisfaction.’ \r\nMarlies, coordinator at De Zuidpoort:\r\n‘I am proud of my colleagues’ flexibility during the coronavirus crisis.’ For example, they \r\ntranslated the complicated measures into simple diagrams that could be understood by a \r\nlot of people. Fantastic!’\r\n“\n\nSDG 1: END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE\r\nResults\r\nIn recent years, we have been setting up collaborations with, for and by people with \r\nexperience with poverty. Examples are dialogue tables, Stressweg, De Zuidsprekers, \r\nworking groups on education, day of resistance against poverty, culture, dignified \r\nfunerals, youth work Jong Gent in Actie, experimental gardens for leisure time, \r\nsetting up the Sociale Kruidenier, Gent Knapt Op.\r\nCity services and the associations where people in poverty speak up made \r\nagreements in order to better streamline and structure the participation of people \r\nliving in poverty. This involves the drafting and evaluation of policy plans, large \r\nlong-term projects (e.g., urban renewal), bottom-up signals and ad-hoc issues. \r\nWe will continue this exercise in the coming period and it may land in the Midfield \r\nParliament to be set up. \r\nThe social midfield and the associations in particular, are an essential partner in \r\nshaping Ghent policy and in taking on board the voice of people in poverty in policy \r\ndecisions.\r\nWith the ‘change coach’ project, the associations are supported in broadening the \r\ntarget group and in optimising collaboration. This project resulted in the drafting \r\nand signing of a declaration of intent between the three associations where people \r\nin poverty speak up.\r\nThe website ‘Poverty Memory’ has been created in order to bundle all initiatives, \r\nactions and methodologies. \r\nBelow is a selection from De Zuidpoort, SIVI and BMLIK’s annual reports:\r\n> De Zuidpoort organised 190 activities in 2019 with a total of 3,276 participants. \r\nThey also won the Federal Prize for Poverty Reduction, topic Participation. \r\n> SIVI conducted a total of 318 table discussions in 2020 - see also ‘Proud of’. SIVI \r\nalso succeeded in getting 85 people with a migrant background involved in various \r\npolicy participation processes. \r\n> At BMLIK they switched from group work to a more individual approach during the \r\ncoronavirus period. Every week, they made ‘doorstep’ visits and phone calls to 59 \r\nfamilies. In this way, they were able to creatively organise participation, action and \r\ndialogue around a number of policy topics.\r\nAmbitions\r\nThe associations and city services involved aim to reach an even wider target group, \r\nso that hard-to-reach groups/minorities can also make their voices heard. \r\nThe methods and insights have since been adopted by other civil society \r\norganisations and city services. This ensures that policy participation by people in \r\npoverty is in the DNA of every city service. In this way, associations, civil society and \r\ncity services are sharing the knowledge and experience they have gained yet further \r\nwith each other.\r\nChallenges\r\nThe associations make a very strong commitment and show great dedication to \r\nvarious social issues and challenges. This creates enormous time and workload \r\npressure for the associations and their staff. As a result, core tasks are sometimes \r\ncompromised.\r\nIn every participation event, the duality between individual needs as opposed to \r\nsocial needs or a need that emanates from a particular target group often comes to",

Toutefois, près d’un Wallon sur \r\ncinq vit dans une situation de risque de pauvreté moné￾taire, soit dans un ménage dont le revenu net équivalent \r\nest inférieur au seuil de pauvreté national (en 2014 : \r\n1 083€ nets par mois pour un isolé ou 2 274€ pour un \r\nménage composé de 2 adultes et 2 enfants de moins de 14 ans). Entre 6 et 10 % de la \r\npopulation wallonne vit dans un ménage en situation de déprivation matérielle, c'est-à￾dire qui cumule l'incapacité à accèder, pour des raisons financières, à des biens et ser￾vices et/ou à se livrer à des activités considérés comme ordinaires et/ou \r\nnécessaires. La Wallonie occupe une position médiane au sein de \r\nl’Union européenne en la matière. \r\nPour appréhender la pauvreté, la part des bénéficiaires de \r\nl’aide sociale peut également être analysée. Celle-ci repré￾sentait, pour les 18 ans et plus, 3,4 % en 2015, alors que \r\nce taux s’élevait à 5,8 % pour les 18-24 ans et les plus \r\nde 65 ans, indiquant que les jeunes et les personnes âgées \r\nsont plus précaires. De plus, une surreprésentation féminine \r\nest observée dans les bénéficiaires de l’aide sociale. Celle-ci \r\naugmente avec l’âge, ce qui peut être expliqué par une partici￾pation plus faible des femmes au marché du travail.\r\nUn autre phénomène étroitement lié à la pauvreté est le surendettement. En Wallonie, la \r\npart des personnes confrontées au surendettement ou à de graves difficultés financières \r\ns’accroit depuis 2006. Ainsi, la part de la population ayant été admise à la procédure de \r\nrèglement collectif des dettes est passée, entre 2006 et 2015, de 0,78 % à 1,44 %. De \r\ntelles difficultés financières poussent les ménages à diminuer leurs dépenses, aggravant \r\nleur situation de pauvreté.\r\n2014\r\n1 wallon sur 5 vit dans \r\nune situation de risque de \r\npauvreté monétaire",

Entre 5,9 % et 10,7 % avec une certitude de 95 %.\r\nÉVOLUTION\r\nLe taux de privation matérielle s’élevait à \r\n8,6 % 2\r\n en Wallonie en 2018. Depuis 2004, \r\non observe une diférence notable entre \r\nrégions : le taux wallon varie de 6 à 10 %, le \r\ntaux bruxellois de 15 à 20 % et le taux famand \r\nentre 1 et 4 %. \r\nSi l’on compare le taux wallon à celui des \r\npays de l’Union européenne, on peut noter \r\nqu’il est plus élevé que celui des pays voisins \r\n(Luxembourg, France, Allemagne et Pays-Bas) \r\net des pays scandinaves, mais proche de l’Ir￾lande et de certains pays méditerranéens \r\n(Espagne et Portugal) et de l’Europe de l’Est \r\n(Tchéquie, Slovaquie, Slovénie et Pologne).\r\nPar ailleurs, si l’on étudie les diférents \r\néléments du taux de privation matérielle, on \r\npeut noter que leur proportion varie. Ainsi, \r\nl’absence de téléphone, de télévision ou de \r\nlave-linge est quasi inexistante en Wallonie \r\nalors que l’absence de réserves fnancières et \r\nl’impossibilité de partir en vacances touchent \r\nchacune entre 35 et 37 % de la population \r\nwallonne.

Chez \r\nles 65 ans et plus, 5,6 % bénéfciaient en \r\n2017 de la garantie de revenu aux personnes \r\nâgées (GRAPA) ou du revenu garanti (RG). \r\nAu total, 3,7 % des majeurs étaient bénéf￾ciaires de l’aide sociale en Wallonie. \r\nDes diférences signifcatives sont obser￾vées selon les classes d’âges : les 18-24 ans \r\net les 65 ans et plus sont les plus touchés \r\n(respectivement 7,1 % et 5,65 % en 2017) \r\npar rapport aux 45-64 ans (1,6 % en 2017), \r\nles 25-44 ans se trouvent quant à eux dans \r\nune situation intermédiaire (3,2 % en 2017). \r\nPour chaque catégorie d’âge, une surre￾présentation des femmes est observée et \r\ncelle-ci augmente avec l’âge, ce qui peut s’ex￾pliquer par une participation plus faible des \r\nfemmes au marché du travail. Si le (E)RIS est \r\nplus important dans les villes, en particulier \r\ndans les bassins industriels, la GRAPA est \r\nelle relativement plus élevée dans les zones \r\nrurales.\r\nLes données montrent aussi que les écarts \r\nentre classes d’âge s’accroissent sur la \r\npériode 2003-2017, les parts respectives des \r\njeunes et des personnes âgées augmentent \r\nsur la période alors que celle des 45-64 ans \r\nest quasi constante et celle des 25-44 ans \r\nmontre une évolution plus modérée. Depuis \r\n2016, la part « des jeunes » de 18-24 ans qui \r\nreçoivent une aide sociale dépasse celle des \r\n65 ans et plus (RG et GRAPA).\r\nLa forte augmentation de la part des béné￾fciaires de l’aide sociale de 18-64 ans à \r\npartir de 2015 s’explique par la limitation \r\ndans le temps des allocations d’insertion : \r\nun certain nombre de demandeurs d’emploi \r\nperdent leurs allocations et sont contraints \r\nde demander le revenu d’intégration sociale. \r\nD’autres ne le demandent pas ou ne l’ob￾tiennent pas.

Toutefois, plusieurs \r\nindicateurs montrent un phénomène \r\nsignifcatif de pauvreté. Un Wallon sur \r\ncinq vit dans une situation de risque \r\nde pauvreté monétaire, soit dans un \r\nménage dont le revenu net équiva￾lent est inférieur au seuil de pauvreté \r\nnational (en 2017 : 1 187 € nets par \r\nmois pour un isolé ou 2 493 € pour \r\nun ménage composé de 2 adultes et \r\n2 enfants de moins de 14 ans). \r\nEntre 6 et 11 % de la population \r\nwallonne vit dans un ménage qui ne \r\npeut pas, pour des raisons fnancières, \r\nposséder les biens et services et/ou \r\nse livrer à des activités considérées \r\ncomme ordinaires et/ou nécessaires. \r\nLa Wallonie occupe une position \r\nmédiane au sein de l’Union européenne \r\nen la matière. \r\nLa part des bénéfciaires d’allocations \r\nd’aide sociale est en augmentation \r\nen Wallonie sur la période 2003-2017. \r\nEn 2017, celle-ci représentait 3,7 % \r\ndes Wallon.ne.s tous âges confondus. \r\nCe taux s’élevait à 7,1 % pour les \r\n18-24 ans et à 5,7 % pour les plus de \r\n65 ans, indiquant que les jeunes et les \r\npersonnes âgées sont plus précaires. De \r\nplus, une surreprésentation féminine \r\nest observée dans les bénéfciaires de \r\nl’aide sociale. Celle-ci augmente avec \r\nl’âge, ce qui peut être expliqué par une \r\nparticipation plus faible des femmes au \r\nmarché du travail.\r\nUn autre phénomène étroitement lié \r\nà la pauvreté est le surendettement. \r\nEn Wallonie, la part des personnes \r\nconfrontées au surendettement ou à de \r\ngraves difcultés fnancières s’accroît \r\ndepuis 2006.

Si bien existe un \r\navance signifcativo respecto al 2001 —66,9% en el censo de ese año— \r\nel reto de vencer la vulnerabilidad y la pobreza es aún muy relevante. \r\nEstas cifras son cercanas a la estimación de pobreza monetaria en \r\nel nivel departamental urbano.

De acuerdo con \r\nel análisis socioespacial de ONU-Habitat, ela￾borado con base en la información del Censo \r\nNacional de Población y Vivienda de 2012, la \r\npoblación indígena en el municipio reside en \r\nlas áreas de mayor pobreza multidimensional \r\n(ver Figura 3).

El 90% de los adultos mayores llegan \r\nde provincias y comunidades aledañas y son \r\nmonolingües aymaras, lo que los aísla y pone \r\nen desventaja frente al resto de la población. \r\nEste grupo poblacional es particularmente \r\nafectado por la pobreza: el 70% de los adul￾tos mayores son pobres y viven sobre todo \r\nen los distritos rurales. Un porcentaje impor￾tante de adultos mayores sobreviven solo \r\ncon la Renta Dignidad (Bs 350,00) teniendo \r\nque cubrir la alimentación, vestimenta y en \r\nalgunos casos el pago de servicios básicos y \r\nalquileres de habitación.\r\nSegún el Sistema del Programa de Registro \r\nÚnico Nacional de Personas con Discapacidad \r\n(SIPRUNPCD) del Ministerio de Salud y Deportes, \r\nal mes de abril del 2022, se tienen registradas \r\n7.799 personas con discapacidad en el munici￾pio de El Alto.

En Bolivia, \r\nestas competencias están dividas entre Entidades Territoriales Autónomas y el nivel central del \r\nEstado, convirtiendo la erradicación de la pobreza en todas sus formas en una responsabilidad \r\ncompartida entre niveles de gobierno. El acceso a servicios esenciales y protección ante even￾tos adversos está usualmente vinculado al nivel de ingresos de los hogares. El objetivo de la \r\npolítica del GAM de La Paz consiste en romper esta relación, garantizando: salud, educación y \r\nempleo de calidad, acceso a cuidado infantil y a redes comunitarias, entre otros servicios bási￾cos; independientemente del nivel de ingresos de sus habitantes. \n\nREPORTE VOLUNTARIO LOCAL: LA PAZ\r\n37\r\n34 El porcentaje considera los no \r\npobres con distancia al umbral \r\nde privación.\r\n35 Proporción de hogares que \r\nno cuentan con los ingresos \r\nsufcientes para satisfacer \r\nlos requerimientos mínimos \r\nde alimentación, vivienda, \r\nsalud, etc.\r\n36 Encuesta Municipal ODS, \r\n2018.\r\n37 Gobierno Autónomo Municipal \r\nde La Paz (2013). Medición de \r\nla pobreza en el municipio de \r\nLa Paz. \r\nEn las últimas décadas, el municipio de La \r\nPaz ha dado importantes pasos en términos \r\nde reducción de la pobreza. Mientras que en \r\n2001 la pobreza medida a través del Índice de \r\nNecesidades Básicas Insatisfechas era del \r\n34,5%, para el 2018 esta proporción se había \r\nreducido al 32%34. De manera similar, desde la \r\nperspectiva de ingresos, en 2012 la incidencia \r\nde la pobreza monetaria35 en el municipio era \r\ndel 33,8%, mientras que para el 2018 decreció \r\nhasta el 25,9%.\r\nSin embargo, en términos de erradicación \r\nde la pobreza, aún existen dos grandes re￾tos para el municipio. En primer lugar, la \r\npandemia del COVID-19 expuso importantes \r\nbrechas en los sistemas de protección y se￾guridad social. Asimismo, los efectos de la \r\ncrisis económica derivada de la emergencia \r\nsanitaria revirtieron parte de los avances al￾canzados hasta el momento en materia de \r\npolítica social, y sus efectos de largo plazo \r\naún están por conocerse. Por esta razón, una \r\nde las prioridades del GAM de La Paz consis￾te en la recolección y análisis de información \r\npermanente y rigurosa, que permita la toma \r\nde decisiones informadas para enfrentar de \r\nmanera efcaz los retos derivados de la pan￾demia por COVID-19. \r\nEl segundo gran reto en materia de pobreza \r\npara el municipio tiene que ver con la rurali￾dad. Mientras que los macrodistritos más \r\ncentrales y urbanos, como el Centro y Sur, tie￾nen niveles de pobreza monetaria cercanos \r\nal 20,5% y 22,4% respectivamente, mientras \r\nlos distritos rurales de Hampaturi y Zongo \r\npresentan tasas del 29,4% y 48,7%36. Esta \r\nbrecha se ahonda cuando la pobreza es ana￾lizada desde el enfoque de Necesidades Bási￾cas Insatisfechas, en este caso la diferencia \r\nentre los distritos supera los 40 puntos por￾centuales, específcamente, las tasas reporta￾das para los macrodistritos Sur y Centro son \r\n24,9% y 18,9%, mientras que las de Hampaturi \r\ny Zongo corresponden a 72,2% y 73,2%, res￾pectivamente. \r\nDe acuerdo con los datos del último Censo \r\nNacional de Población y Vivienda (2012), uno \r\nde los principales problemas relacionado con \r\nlas Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas es el \r\nhacinamiento y la falta de habitaciones en las \r\nviviendas, que afecta sobre todo a los macro￾distritos de Max Paredes (54,1%) y Periférica \r\n(44,6%), así como a los macrodistritos rurales, \r\ncon valores por encima del 70% en Zongo y \r\nHampaturi37.\r\nAhora, dentro del UMF se abordan dos aproxi￾maciones importantes a la pobreza, que sue￾len quedar por fuera del análisis tradicional. \r\nLa primera de ellas hace referencia a la segu￾ridad de la tenencia de la tierra y la propiedad, \r\nel indicador UMF se relaciona con la meta 1.4 \r\nde los ODS “De aquí a 2030, garantizar que \r\ntodos los hombres y mujeres, en particular \r\nlos pobres y los vulnerables, tengan los mis￾mos derechos a los recursos económicos \r\ny acceso a […] la propiedad y el control de la \r\ntierra y otros bienes, la herencia, los recur￾sos naturales […]”. La proporción de hogares \r\nque son dueños de una propiedad y tienen un \r\nfolio legal, sobre el número total de hogares \r\npropietarios, en el municipio de La Paz es del \r\n80%, de acuerdo con la Encuesta Municipal \r\nde ODS, 2018. Este indicador mide los resul￾tados de las políticas que buscan fortalecer \r\nlos derechos de propiedad para todos, inclu￾yendo a mujeres y otros grupos vulnerables. \r\nFortalecer los sistemas de tenencia es un \r\npaso importante para regularizar los proble￾mas derivados del crecimiento poblacional y \r\nla urbanización.\r\nLa segunda, consiste en la vulnerabilidad \r\nocasionada por desastres naturales. La ex￾posición a los riesgos ambientales se co￾rrelaciona de manera importante con la \r\npobreza, debido a la precariedad de los asen￾tamientos, la localización en sitios de riesgo \r\npor dinámicas de gentrifcación y/o urbaniza￾ción descontrolada y la falta de redes socia￾les y fnancieras de apoyo. En este contexto, \r\nel Marco de Sendai para la Reducción del \r\nRiesgo de Desastres 2015-2030, adoptado \r\nde manera paralela e interconectada a los \r\nODS, busca reducir sustancialmente la mor￾talidad mundial por desastres para el 2030. \r\nEn particular, busca que el promedio de per￾sonas afectadas entre 2020-2030 sea menor \r\nal reportado entre 2005-2015. En el 2020, en \r\nLa Paz se registró una tasa de 16,4 personas \r\nafectadas por desastres naturales por cada \r\n100.00 habitantes.\n\nREPORTE VOLUNTARIO LOCAL: LA PAZ\r\n38\r\nMetas voluntarias 2025: \r\n• Reducir por debajo del 4,5% la incidencia de la pobreza extrema en el municipio.\r\nACCIONES DEL GOBIERNO AUTÓNOMO MUNICIPAL \r\nDE LA PAZ\r\nEl Gobierno Autónomo Municipal de La Paz cuenta con acciones programa￾das para alcanzar el ODS 1 en el eje La Paz saludable y segura del Plan Mu￾nicipal “La Paz Ciudad en Movimiento”, además de acciones programadas \r\nen el Plan Territorial de Desarrollo Integral 2021-2025 (PTDI) en los sectores \r\nde justicia y de cultura y en el Plan Estratégico Institucional (PEI) en el sector \r\njusticia, como se muestra a continuación.\r\nMapa 2.

Para evaluar \r\nlas tendencias recientes en el \r\nmunicipio es necesario usar \r\nla información proveniente de \r\nlas Encuestas de Hogares del \r\nINE, que solo es representa￾tiva para el nivel urbano del \r\ndepartamento.\r\nNota: Cálculo realizado para la zona urbana del departamento de Santa Cruz. Meta voluntaria a \r\n2025 trazada a partir de la tendencia lineal necesaria para cumplir la meta de reducir a la mitad \r\nla pobreza en el 2030 (Meta ODS 1.2), tomando como base la información de la zona urbana del \r\ndepartamento para el 2015. \r\nFuente: Elaboración propia, con base en las Encuestas de Hogares (2015-2020).\r\nErradicar la pobreza en todas sus formas es uno de los principales de￾safíos globales. En el nivel local, abordar la pobreza implica garantizar el \r\nacceso a servicios integrales que sirvan a las personas como protección \r\na los choques económicos y el estrés. En la medición municipal del Atlas \r\nde los ODS en Bolivia (2020), que usó los datos del CNPV-2012, Santa \r\nCruz de la Sierra destacó como el tercer municipio del país que más cer￾ca se encontraba de cumplir el ODS 1, únicamente superado por La Paz \r\ny Colcapirhua. \r\nEn el 2020, la crisis económica originada por el COVID-19 retrasó los \r\nesfuerzos mundiales en materia de la lucha contra la pobreza, expo￾niendo brechas económicas y aumentando los márgenes mundiales \r\nde población vulnerable. A pesar de esto, en la zona urbana del depar￾tamento de Santa Cruz34 la pobreza no aumentó durante el 2020 y se \r\nmantuvo dentro de la tendencia para el cumplimiento local de la meta \r\n1.2 (ver Figura 1).\r\nFigura 1. Proporción de la población que vive por debajo del umbral \r\nnacional de pobreza\r\nIndicador para el municipio\r\nMeta 2030\r\nTendencia para cumplimiento en 2030 (base 2015)\r\nMeta 2025\n\nREPORTE VOLUNTARIO LOCAL: SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA\r\n25\r\n35 Encuesta de Hogares, INE, \r\n(2020).\r\n36 Para el municipio de Santa \r\nCruz de la Sierra la línea de \r\npobreza en el área urbana se \r\nestablece en 839,41 Bolivianos \r\npor persona al mes (INE, en \r\nbase a los datos de precios \r\npromedio al consumidor para \r\nlas 9 ciudades capitales). \r\nSi bien el avance ha sido signifcativo, el ODS 1 \r\nsigue representando un reto importante para \r\nel GAMSC ya que el 21,8% de la población ur￾bana del departamento35 vive por debajo de la \r\nlínea nacional de pobreza36.\r\nLa pobreza tiene muchas otras dimensiones \r\nque superan los niveles de ingreso y el en￾foque monetario, como el nivel educativo, la \r\ncalidad del empleo, el acceso a servicios bá￾sicos y el cuidado de la primera infancia, que \r\nson esenciales para comprender las limitacio￾nes que enfrentan las personas en situación \r\nde pobreza en el municipio y que se plasman \r\nen el análisis de los demás ODS incluidos en \r\neste documento. \r\nUna característica importante de la pobreza \r\nradica en su focalización territorial. La con￾centración de la pobreza desde la perspecti￾va de las Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas \r\n(NBI) se hace evidente al desagregarla por \r\nmanzanos. En la fgura 2, se observa que los \r\nmayores niveles de concentración de pobreza \r\npor NBI se localiza en las áreas periurbanas, \r\nrelacionándose con un crecimiento urbano \r\nque acentúa la marginalización, con una ex￾pansión de los asentamientos precarios en \r\nlas zonas más marginales del municipio. Esto \r\na su vez permite al GAMSC identifcar espa￾cialmente las prioridades de inversión.\r\nSe evidencia que el acceso a electricidad \r\n(99%) y agua (96%) es bastante amplia (ver \r\nODS 6 y 7). Por el contrario, algunos retos se \r\nidentifcan en el acceso al cuidado de la pri￾mera infancia (ver ODS 4) y la informalidad \r\nlaboral (ver ODS 8). \r\nRespecto a la asignación de recursos, en el \r\n2020 el GAMSC dedicó el 27% de su gasto \r\nFigura 2. Incidencia de la Pobreza por NBI en el municipio de Santa Cruz de la Sierra \r\npúblico a los servicios esenciales de salud \r\ny educación. En particular, el 9,27% del gas￾to público municipal se dedicó a educación, \r\nmientras que el 18,4% se dedicó a servicios \r\nde salud. Este último rubro, presentó un au￾mento importante respecto a la línea de base \r\ndel 2015 (15,39%) para hacer frente a la emer￾gencia del COVID-19.\r\nEsri, HERE, Garmin, FAO,\r\nNOAA, USGS\r\n¹\r\nFuente: Elaboración ONU-Habitat, en base a datos del GAMSC, 2022; INE, CNPV-2012.\r\nFondo de mapa: OSM.\r\n* Los límites político administrativos son referenciales.\n\nREPORTE VOLUNTARIO LOCAL: SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA\r\n26\r\nMetas voluntarias a 2025: \r\n• Reducir la proporción de la población que vive por debajo del umbral na￾cional de pobreza a menos del 20% \r\nPara el cumplimiento de estas metas voluntarias el Plan Territorial de De￾sarrollo Integral (PTDI) de Santa Cruz de la Sierra (2021-2015) se articula \r\ncon el Pilar 1 de la Agenda Patriótica 2025, referente a la erradicación de la \r\npobreza. \r\nAcciones para lograr el cumplimiento del Objetivo: \r\nRegularizar barrios en aplicación de la normativa municipal, coadyuvando \r\nal ciudadano al mejoramiento de sus entornos, permitiendo el acceso a ser￾vicios básicos de calidad y al uso y aprobación de las áreas de uso público \r\npara su esparcimiento. \r\nCobijar a personas en situación de calle en albergues transitorios, brindando \r\nalimentación y atención psicológica, social y legal.\r\nEjecutar acciones que fortalezcan la disminución de la pobreza, construyen￾do centros de salud y unidades educativas que están plasmados en el PTDI, \r\nampliando la cobertura de estos servicios.\r\n| Foto: Gobierno Autónomo Municipal de Santa Cruz de la Sierra",

There were 333,990 \n\nChapter 01 – SDG 1. No poverty.\r\n16\r\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REPORT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2021\r\nthousand cotton masks, double￾faced, in accordance with the National \r\nHealth Surveillance Agency standards, \r\ndistributed for free to the population.\r\nEven in a pandemic \r\nscenario, the state of Pará \r\ncreated 32,789 formal jobs \r\nin 2020, in addition to an \r\nincrease of 5.71% in the \r\naverage income of employed \r\npeople, from BRL 1,609.00 \r\nin the 3rd quarter of 2019 \r\nto BRL 1,701 .00 in the 3rd \r\nquarter/2020. This result \r\nwas largely influenced by the \r\nactions and articulations of \r\nthe State Government along \r\nwith the economic sectors, \r\nand employment generation \r\nand intermediation policies, \r\nsuch as the First Profession \r\nProgram (from the original, \r\nPrograma Primeiro Ofício), \r\nwhich in 2020 formally hired \r\naround 1,150 young people.\r\nRegarding the goal 1.2, in line with \r\nthe reduction of non-monetary \r\npoverty, the State Government \r\ncarried out actions aiming to reduce \r\nshortages in the health, education and \r\nadequate housing areas, in addition to \r\nexpanding access to basic services and \r\ninfrastructure and reducing violations \r\nof basic rights, measures that also \r\ncontribute to the goal 1.4.\r\nIn this context, in 2020, Pará Government, \r\nheld an action linked to the exercise of \r\ncitizenship in the 12 Integration Regions, \r\nby issuing 362,222 identity documents to \r\nthe population in 133 cities.\r\nIn line with the policy of socio-territorial \r\nappreciation and land rights, it is nottory \r\nthe issue of three collective titles in the \r\nBaixo Amazonas and Marajó regions for \r\nassociations of Remnants of Quilombola\r\n(slave descendant) Communities, \r\nbenefiting 102 families.\r\nIn the area of education, aiming to \r\nexpand the number of vacancies and \r\nto improve the conditions of state \r\npublic schools, the Government of Pará \r\ndelivered, in 2019, four new schools \r\nand 22 renovated schools, in nine of \r\nthe Integration Regions. In 2020, four \r\nnew state and municipal schools and 24 \r\nrenovated schools were delivered in eight \r\nIntegration Regions.\r\nIn the area of culture, in 2019, the \r\ncooperation agreement signed between \r\nthe Government of Pará and the Ministry \r\nof Culture stands out, aiming to boost \r\ncultural potential in its various forms of \r\nmanifestations and access to culture as \r\na constitutional right of every citizen. \n\nChapter 01 – SDG 1. No poverty.\r\n17\r\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REPORT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2021\r\nIt is worth mentioning the High Tide \r\nPopular Culture Program (from the \r\noriginal, Programa Preamar da \r\nCultura Popular) , which made music, \r\ntheater, dance, audiovisual, visual arts, \r\nfolkloric manifestations, fashion and \r\nfood culture available in museums, \r\npublic spaces and headquarters of \r\npopular associations, as well as other \r\ninitiatives that contributed to cultural \r\ndissemination, such as “Music in \r\nMuseums” (from the original, Músicas nos \r\nMuseus) and “Creative Parks” (from the \r\noriginal, Parques Criativos), both focused \r\non democratizing access to cultural \r\nprograms and the creative economy.\r\nAiming to improve infrastructure and \r\nmobility for the population, especially the \r\nmost vulnerable and residing in peripheral \r\nneighborhoods in the capital, in 2020, \r\nthe Government of Pará delivered the \r\nTapanã Highway, located in Belém, \r\ncapital of the state, with approximately \r\n5 km. Equipped with a new system of \r\npaving, drainage, duplication of the lane, \r\nsidewalk with accessibility and cycle lane, \r\nlighting, signalization and leisure space, \r\nthe work will impact not only the urban \r\nflow and integration, but significantly, \r\nthe living conditions of the population \r\nof the surroundings.\r\nThe Asphalt Throughout Pará \r\nProgram (from the original, Asfalto \r\npor todo Pará) stands out, linked to \r\nthe improvement of infrastructure \r\nand housing conditions in the cities of \r\nPará, by providing paving and asphalt \r\ncoating, curb construction, sidewalks \r\nand earthmoving services, with an \r\ninvestment of approximately R$ 690.6 \r\nmillion, in 505 km of urban roads, \r\nbenefiting 96 municipalities in the 12 \r\nIntegration Regions.\r\nStill focusing on the \r\nexpansion of the state’s \r\ninfrastructure, in 2020, \r\n3,181km of highways \r\nwere preserved, built \r\nand restored, in 55 \r\nmunicipalities, covering nine \r\nIntegration Regions, with \r\ninvestments of around R$ \r\n627.1 million, in addition to \r\nthree waterway terminals \r\ndelivered, in the amount \r\nof R$ 14 million, benefiting \r\nthe populations of Baixo \r\nAmazonas and Tocantins.\r\nConsidering the right to adequate \r\nhousing as fundamental, in 2019, the \r\nGovernment of Pará created “Your \r\nHome” Program (from the original, \r\nPrograma Sua Casa) that makes it \r\npossible to build, expand, renovate, \r\nimprove and adapt the houses of low￾income families, with emphasis on the \r\nconcession of cash aid for the payment \r\nof labor services. In 2020, the program \n\nChapter 01 – SDG 1. No poverty.\r\n18\r\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REPORT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2021\r\nbenefited 8,673 families from 88 cities in \r\n11 of the 12 Integration Regions of Pará.\r\nAiming to make the Social Protection \r\nSystem available to everyone, in line with \r\nthe goal 1.3 of the 2030 Agenda, in 2019, \r\nhighly complex services were guaranteed \r\nwith the maintenance of seven shelters, \r\nwhich treated 110 women in situations \r\nof violence in the Integration Regions \r\nof Guajará, Baixo Amazonas, Carajás\r\nand Tapajós, in addition to 89 elderly \r\npeople and 267 migrants in transit. In \r\nthis last modality, 170 Venezuelans, of \r\nthe Warao ethnic group, were assisted, \r\nexemplifying the Government’s attention \r\nto the migratory issue that affects \r\nthe territory of Pará, including the \r\nadaptation of a new space to offer \r\nsocial assistance services.\r\nIn order to strengthen local family \r\nfarming, and at the same time promote \r\neconomic and social inclusion, in 2019, \r\n594 families from seven Integration \r\nRegions were assisted in the Food \r\nAcquisition Program (from the original, \r\nPrograma de Aquisição de Alimento), \r\nwith an investment of R$ 474,000, \r\nwhich allowed the access to food in the \r\nquantity, quality and regularity necessary \r\nfor families and individuals in a situation \r\nof food and nutrition insecurity, served \r\nby the social assistance network \r\nand food and nutrition equipment, \r\nin addition to encouraging the \r\nconsumption and appreciation of food \r\nproduced by family farming.\r\nIn 2020, as a contribution \r\nto the goal 1.3 and in line \r\nwith the Basic Operating \r\nStandard of the Unified \r\nSocial Assistance System, \r\nthe State Government \r\nguaranteed state co￾financing by transferring \r\nfunds to 136 municipalities \r\nin Pará. R$4.6 million were \r\ntransferred from the state \r\ntreasury to foster the \r\nexpansion, maintenance and \r\nqualification of the Unified \r\nSocial Assistance System’s \r\nbasic and special social \r\nprotection services, carried \r\nout, among others, in the \r\nSocial Assistance Reference \r\nCenters (from the original, \r\nCRAS) and Specialized \r\nCenters Reference for \r\nSocial Assistance (from the \r\noriginal, CREAS), which are \r\nInstitutional Host Units for \r\nchildren, the elderly, women, \r\nadults and families.\r\nThe Government of Pará, in 2020, \r\nprovided emergency assistance to the \r\nvulnerable, aiming the preservation \r\nof life and the process of rescuing \r\ncitizenship, through actions to host 1,050 \n\nChapter 01 – SDG 1.

The benefits of direct \r\nincome transfer to Pará \r\nfamilies are highlighted, \r\nwhich constitute a \r\nguarantee of social \r\nprotection, materializing \r\nin survival and income \r\nsecurity. In this context, we \r\nhighlight the transfer of the \r\namount of R$ 23.8 million, \r\nbenefiting 1,982 people \r\naffected by leprosy, in 107 \r\nmunicipalities in Pará.\r\nThe actions of the State Government \r\nin 2019, aiming the resilience of the \r\npoor and those in vulnerable situations \r\nare highlighted, in accordance with the \r\ngoal 1.5, in which the Civil Defense, \r\nin partnership with the Municipal \r\nCoordinations, assisted the population \r\nvictim of disasters occurred in 40 \r\nmunicipalities, with the distribution of \r\n11,886 basic food baskets and the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian kits, with an \r\ninvestment of R$ 2.6 million.

One example is social exclusion, where \r\nthere is a lack of interconnection of statistics \r\non poverty throughout the territory and the \r\nrelated social phenomena between individu￾al departments and institutions. The absence \r\nof some data concerning ethnic groups in the \r\nCzech Republic in particular is generally sensi￾tive and complicates the resolution of this is￾sue. There is a shortage of studies focusing on \r\nthe systematic assessment of the impact of so￾cial policies, including the regulation of bene￾ft systems, in general. In addition, only a few \r\nof the studies concerning excluded locations \r\ndiscuss the procedural aspects of creating po￾licies, for instance the issue of public partici￾pation in decisions or the active involvement \r\nof target groups. Despite this, attention is paid \r\nto the creation of analyses, the compilation of \r\ndata, and work with data in a number of newly \r\napproved strategic materials at national level \r\nacross areas.\r\n1.1 There is no extreme poverty in the Czech Republic. \r\n1.2 In the case of the Czech Republic, it will be very \r\ndifcult to reduce the percentage of people living in \r\nrelative poverty to one half because this percentage \r\n(10%) is already one of the lowest in the EU and world. \r\nHowever, one third of the population lives just above \r\nthe poverty line.\r\n1.3 The basic social protection system fully covers all \r\nvulnerable groups.\r\n1.4 Equal rights in access to economic resources, ba￾sic services and ownership are legislatively enshrined. \r\nThe unavailability of social housing and the indebted￾ness of socially excluded persons is increasing.\r\n1.5 In the Czech Republic there is a functional fra￾mework to reduce the risks associated with natural \r\ndisasters and technical accidents. \r\n1.a The share of ofcial development assistance \r\n(ODA) to GNI is not approaching the commitment of \r\n0.33% of GNI. The average ODA contribution for the \r\nCzech Republic ranges at around 0.14% of GNI. An \r\nexample of a current development cooperation pro￾ject is inclusive education for vulnerable children in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n1.b The internal dimension of the target is covered \r\nfrom the strategic aspect, but the results of the ac￾tivities are not completely clear. Selected SDGs are \r\ncovered by the Development Cooperation Strategy \r\nCR 2018-2030 from the external dimension, neverthe￾less gender equality and poverty are not among \r\ndevelopment cooperation priorities.\r\nDense social protection network\r\nThe basic social protection system fully co￾vers all at-risk citizen groups (children, the \r\nunemployed, the elderly, people with disa￾bilities, pregnant women, new-borns, vic￾tims of work injuries, poor and vulnerable \r\npeople). Ensuring a minimum income (living \r\nand subsistence minimum) and assistance in \r\nmaterial need are legislatively regulated in \r\nthe Czech Republic’s social protection system. \r\nBenefts in material need (a subsistence allo￾wance, housing supplement and a lump sum \r\nfor emergency immediate assistance) are paid \r\nout on the basis of these legal regulations. Ac￾cording to the Act on State Social Support, so-\r\n-called family benefts (child allowance, birth \r\nallowance, funeral allowance, housing allo￾wance and parental allowance) are paid out. \r\nThe law also stipulates the conditions under \r\nwhich unemployment benefts and employee \r\nprotection if the employer is insolvent can be",

The un￾employment rate for those over 15 has de￾creased from 32 percent in 2010 to 29 percent \r\nin 2013, and further down to 17 percent in \r\n2019.5 Pension reform has contributed to 25 \r\npercent of the reduction in poverty between \r\n2009 and 2015, as beneft rates increased.6 \r\nEmployment grew from 38 percent to 47 per￾cent between 2010 and 2019, driven primarily \r\nby the service, construction and manufacturing \r\nsectors. During this period, these three sectors \r\nhave accounted for 55 percent of poverty re￾duction. In rural areas, agriculture and construction have contributed to 33 percent of poverty reduction. \r\nDespite reductions in poverty and income inequality, these remain higher than in the EU and countries \r\nin the region with similar development levels. Poverty is concentrated among vulnerable groups. Every \r\nffth citizen and every third household with children are poor. The impact of social transfers on poverty \r\nreduction (without considering pensions as income) has been limited (lowering the poverty rate from \r\n4.6 percent in 2013 to 3.7 percent in 2017), unlike the impact in the EU where the diference between \r\npoverty rates with and without social transfers (but with pensions included) ranges from 10 percent to \r\n15 percent over the same period. The impact of pensions is much larger. If social transfers and pensions \r\nwere eliminated, the poverty rate would be 40 percent. There is a need for signifcant reforms, especially \r\nof the social security cash benefts for vulnerable groups.\r\nLegislative and Strategic Initiatives\r\nIn 2019, the parliament adopted three key laws under the social protection reform agenda - Law on So￾cial Protection, Law on Social Security for the Elderly and amended Law on Child Protection.

Several measures have been implemented, including \r\nthe establishment of daily and temporary residence services, respite family care, halfway houses, home \r\nassistance/ home care, and personal assistance. Their aim has been to better match care to the needs \r\nof benefciaries –including the elderly, people with disabilities, and the homeless, victims of domestic \r\nviolence, street children, and drug abusers. The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MoLSP), with sup￾port from the UN, is introducing the practice of case management in social protection and social welfare, \r\nwhich is expected to enhance further the country’s eforts to eliminate poverty. The 2019 reform, which \r\nstarted with the adoption of the Law on Social Protection, the Law on Social Security for the Elderly and \r\nthe amendment of the Law on Child Protection, has streamlined and expanded social assistance pro￾grammes (see box below for details).\r\nBox 2: The Social Financial Assistance and Guaranteed Minimum Assistance Programs\r\nBefore the 2019 reform, a key programme in support of the poor was the Social Financial Assis￾tance (SFA) programme. The reform replaced it with the Guaranteed Minimum Assistance (GMA) \r\nprogramme. Under SFA, recipients were eligible for benefts if they earned less than 47 Euro per \r\nmonth. This increased to 65 Euro under GMA. GMA also replaced the SFA provision where benefts \r\nwould be reduced by 50 percent after three years of programme usage. Additionally, GMA doubled \r\nthe amount that a four-person household receives monthly under SFA from 49 Euro to 110 Euro. \r\nIn addition, each GMA household receives an additional 16 Euro per month to cover heating costs \r\nin the six months of the heating season. So far, this measure has been used only minimally (3,163 \r\nbenefciaries) due to administrative difculties.\r\nThe Government has also simplifed access to child benefts by removing the requirement that one par￾ent should be employed and extending the right to low-income families. Following these changes, the \r\nnumber of children benefting from the subsidy increased from 6,960 to 21,591 within the frst year of \r\nimplementation.\n\nVoluntary National Review | 22\r\nIn the past eight years, MoLSP has implemented the Conditional Cash Allowance Programme through \r\nwhich it has allocated 12,000 MKD (195 Euro) annually for children from SFA-receiving households. This \r\nprogramme has led to an increase in the rate of children attending high school, especially girls. Encour￾aged by these results, the Government has expanded it to primary school students as well. Overall, 2,398 \r\nhigh-school students were supported by the Conditional Cash Allowance Programme in May 2019 and \r\n8,861 primary-school students benefted from its expansion. In May 2019, the Law on Child Protection\r\nwas amended to allow for the introduction of an “educational children cash allowance” for children from \r\nlow-income households enrolled in primary and secondary education. Further, as part of the reform of \r\nthe child protection system, one-of fnancial support of 20,000 MKD (325 Euro) for the second child was \r\nintroduced in 2019.\r\nMoLSP has introduced measures tailored to the needs of vulnerable groups, including the socially de￾prived and poor. Since 2007, an annual Operational Plan for active employment programmes and mea￾sures has been formulated at the national level as the main tool to decrease the unemployment rate \r\nand improve the labour market participation of vulnerable groups. It combines eforts in support of \r\nself-employment, employment of young people, those who are unemployed long-term, women, persons \r\nwith disabilities, and those who require improved labor market skills. Special attention in the last few \r\nyears has been given to measures to support the most disadvantaged groups, including social assistance \r\nbenefciaries, in order to improve their skills, employability and inclusion in the labour market.\r\nKey Challenges\r\nThe country has a high youth unemployment rate and one of the largest gender gaps in workforce par￾ticipation among European and Central Asian countries.7 These two factors contribute to high levels of \r\nyouth emigration – including youth with high skill sets – which is a signifcant impediment to economic \r\ndevelopment. The country is implementing measures to improve living conditions to contain the emigra￾tion of skilled people.\r\nAlthough the percentage of employed who are at risk of poverty has been decreasing– falling from 11 \r\npercent in 2012 to 9 percent in 2018 – the Government aims to strengthen this trend. The improvement \r\nof labour productivity and economic competitiveness remains a serious challenge, which is related to the \r\nhuman capital available in the country. The size of the informal economy remains signifcant. Moreover, \r\nthere is a mismatch between skill sets demanded by the labour market and the skills of students grad￾uating from secondary schools and universities, which is a refection of the need for further reforms in \r\nthe education sector.\r\nThere is a lack of detailed poverty data, which hampers efective policy analysis and evidence-based de￾cision-making. Additionally, several key strategic frameworks are about to expire (including the National \r\nStrategy for Poverty Reduction and Social Exclusion 2010-2020).\r\nFigure 9: Percent of employed persons at risk of poverty (18 years of age and older)\r\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n10.2\r\n11.1 11.1\r\n9.4 9.8 8.9 9.0 9.0 8.8\r\n7 NATO Parliamentary Assembly, The Republic of North Macedonia: Political Change, NATO Accession and Economic Transition, page 4.\n\nVoluntary National Review | 23\r\nSource: EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey Annual\r\nNext Steps\r\nKey areas of focus for the Government are:\r\n•\t Implementing the newly adopted laws, including the Law on Social Protection and the Law on \r\nSocial Security for the Elderly;\r\n•\t Supporting the employment of vulnerable people through measures envisaged in the National \r\nEmployment Strategy and the Strategy for Informal Economy and Operational plans for active \r\nprograms and measures for employment and services on the labor market;\r\n•\t Proceeding with Public Administration Reform;\r\n•\t Developing the Law on Balanced Regional Development, which presents opportunities for accel￾erated growth;\r\n•\t Developing the National Strategy for Integration of Refugees and Foreigners, which will provide \r\nan efective mechanism for refugee inclusion.",

The country has been making steady progress in its fight \r\nagainst hunger and malnourishment. Rwanda has established a \r\nmonitoring process that includes conducting Comprehensive Food \r\nSecurity and Vulnerability Analyses (CFSVA) to assess food security and \r\nvulnerability under the leadership of the National Institute of Statistics \r\nof Rwanda. The fifth analysiswas produced in 2018. The analyses \r\nbegan in 2006 and the latest CFSVA results highlights the continuing \r\npositive trends. Rwanda has made great strides in reducing poverty and \r\nmalnutrition in the country. Agriculture, the main sector contributing \r\nimproved food security, has been growing, on average, by 6 percent \r\nover the last decade.. According to the 2018 CFSVA report, 81.3 \r\npercent of all households (approximately 2,034,942) are food secure \r\n(i.e., they are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without \r\nFigure 4: Malnutrition among children under 5 years compared to the WHO severity threshold\r\n60\r\n50\r\n40\r\n30\r\n20\r\n10\r\n0\r\n10\r\n9\r\n8\r\n7\r\n6\r\n5\r\n4\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1\r\n0\r\n30\r\n25\r\n20\r\n15\r\n10\r\n5\r\n0\r\nSource: Rwanda DHS 2014/15\r\nStunting\r\nPrevalence among children under 5\r\nWasting \r\nPrevalence among children under 5\r\nUnderweight \r\nPrevalence among children under 5\r\n1992\r\n2000\r\n2005\r\n2010\r\n2014/15\r\n1992\r\n2000\r\n2005\r\n2010\r\n2014/15\r\n1992\r\n2000\r\n2005\r\n2010\r\n2014/15\r\n57\r\n48\r\n52\r\n44\r\n5\r\n8,7\r\n4,8\r\n2,8\r\n2,2\r\n24\r\n20\r\n18\r\n11\r\n9\r\n38\r\nWHO severity threshold\r\nHigh severity\n\n32\r\nCHAPTER 3.

For instance, \r\naccessing adequate amounts of food becomes more complicated \r\nduring the lean seasons. These periods are generally coupled with \r\nan increase in food prices, which in turn leads to food inflation, thus \r\nreducing a household’s purchasing power. \r\nAccording to the 2019 International Food Policy Research Institute \r\n(IFPRI) report, Rwanda scored of 6.1 in agricultural transformation. \r\nIn addition, Rwanda was ranked the 2017 best-performing country \r\n(AU, 2017) and is considered among those on track to fulfill the \r\nMalabo commitment by 2025 (as a part of the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme, CAADP). \r\nRwanda’s agriculture is exposed to climate effects, such as droughts \r\nand floods, and crop yield levels are still below potential levels, as \r\nindicated in Figure 5.\r\nInterventions and opportunities to accelerate progress\r\nUnder the framework of the fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture \r\nTransformation (PSTA-4), the Government of Rwanda’s priorities \r\nfor agriculture include: (i) irrigation (including small scale); (ii) a Crop \r\nIntensification Programme (CIP) focusing mainly on farmers’ access \r\nto agriculture inputs, extension services and land use consolidation; \r\n(iii) erosion control; and (iv) a livestock development programme. \r\nFurthermore, the Government of Rwanda has established an ICT \r\nplatform - E-Soko - aiming at providing agricultural market pricing \r\ninformation to farmers, thus enabling them to make informed decisions.\r\nIn addition, the Government of Rwanda recognizes the key role \r\nthat women play in the agriculture sector, producing for both home \r\nReduced overall child malnutrition,\r\nhowever stunting is still a challenge \r\n(38%, 2015) \r\nRWANDA \r\nBEST \r\nPERFORMER \r\nin Agricultural \r\nTransformation \r\naccording to \r\nAU Malabo \r\nCommitment \r\nreport with a\r\n Score of\r\n6.1 out of 10\r\n(2018)\n\n2019 RWANDA VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW (VNR) REPORT \r\n33\r\nconsumption and the market. The Government has developed an \r\nagriculture gender mainstreaming strategy to guide the integration \r\nof gender in the agriculture sector. Despite the high representation \r\nof women in this sector, challenges remain, including addressing \r\nthe higher proportion of women still engaged in the production \r\naspect of the value chain, with fewer involved in agro-processing, \r\nmarketing and export. This highlights the need to scale up \r\nhousehold-based approaches that promote equitable household \r\ndecision-making in regard to agriculture produce and other \r\nhousehold resources.\r\nThe current PSTA-4 considers that “accessibility of food will be \r\nenhanced through higher household incomes combined with greater \r\nresilience to market and production shocks.” Factors that influence \r\nfood accessibility and resilience to production and market risks \r\ninclude improved storage capabilities, early warning and market \r\ninformation systems, and insurance schemes. The new strategy \r\nrecognizes that country-wide access to food will be achieved when \r\nall households have sufcient resources to obtain appropriate food \r\n(through production, purchase and/or direct support under social \r\nprotection) for a nutrient-rich diet.\r\nFigure 5: Yield gaps for priority crops under the Crop Intensification Programme\r\n100%\r\n90%\r\n80%\r\n70%\r\n60%\r\n50%\r\n40%\r\n30%\r\n20%\r\n10%\r\n0%\r\nBush Beans Cassava Climbing \r\nBeans\r\nMaize Potatoes Rice Soybeans Wheat\r\nCurrent Yield share of potential Untapped potential\r\n26% 61% 53% 55% 43% 17% 70% 51%\r\n74% 39% 47% 45% 57% 83% 30% 49%\r\nRwanda is making \r\ngood progress towards \r\nachieving food \r\nsecurity through Crop \r\nIntensifcation Program\r\n(Access to subsidies input, \r\nEnhanced extension service, \r\nLand use consolidation), Erosion \r\ncontrol, irrigarion, etc.;\r\nNational Early \r\nChildhood Development \r\nProgram, a multi-sectoral \r\nintervention to address \r\nmalnutrition. \n\n34\r\nCHAPTER 3. REVIEW OF SDGs IMPLEMENTATION IN RWANDA \r\nRecognizing the urgency of protecting children from 0-6 years from \r\nthe effects of poverty and its implications for human capital, the \r\nGovernment has put in place a multi-sectoral programme, the National \r\nEarly Childhood Development Programme (NECDP) (2016-2021). The \r\nNECDP is intended to eradicate child malnutrition and calls for all partners \r\nto work in a harmonized and integrated manner with the leadership of \r\nthe Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). The ECD \r\npolicy and strategic plan have further been informed by and aligned to \r\nVision 2020, the revised family policy, the National Gender Policy and the \r\nNational Integrated Child Rights Policy (ICRP). \r\nIn partnership with DPs, the Government of Rwanda supplies micronutrient \r\npowder (Ongera Intungamubiri) regularly to children aged 6-23 months \r\nand pregnant and lactating women in vulnerable households in all 30 \r\ndistricts. The Kinyarwanda phrase, Ongera Intungamubiri, which means \r\n“increase nutrients” is a powdered blend of 15 essential vitamins and \r\nminerals that can be added to semi-solid or mashed food just before \r\nthe child eats. Packaged in single serving sachets, it allows families to \r\nfortify food for their young child with the safe and appropriate level of \r\nvitamins and minerals important for their growth and development. To \r\nwiden its coverage, the fortified blended food (FBF) is also distributed to \r\nhealth facilities. In addition, milk is distributed to children 5 years with \r\nacute malnutrition. Furthermore, school feeding programmes, which \r\nseek to prevent and reduce malnutrition among school-going children \r\nin early childhood education (ECE) and early childhood development \r\n(ECD) programmes are being strengthened. The One Cup of Milk per \r\nChild Program, which is run under the school feeding programme, is \r\npreventing and reducing malnutrition among school-going children. To \r\ndate, the programme has reached 431,348 children. It is reported to \r\nhave boosted the enrolment rate of children under 6 years.\r\nWith regards to scaling up ECD interventions, 4,139 ECDs have been \r\nestablished to date, including model ECDs centers and community￾based ECDs, such as village kitchens. These are demonstration kitchens \r\nwhere parents, especially those with malnourished children, learn to \r\nprepare a balanced diet using locally-produced food.\r\nThe NECDP has given priority to increasing parents’ knowledge and \r\nskills, based on the belief that the family is the primary institution through \r\nwhich quality optimal care and early stimulation can be provided. As a \r\nresult, 15,000 parents have been trained nationwide. Furthermore, the \r\nknowledge and capacity of health care providers and community health \r\nworkers on screening, growth monitoring and overall ECD, has improved.\r\n5.2% \r\n5.3% \r\n5.4\r\n%AGRICULTURAL 3.8% GROWTH",

         "60 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | ICELAND 2023\r\nGoal 2 Zero Hunger\r\nThe supply of nutritious food in Iceland is good enough so no one should have\r\nto live with hunger. \r\nNo significant malnutrition exists among the Icelandic population.\r\nNutritional challenges are mainly related to the prevalence of obesity. \r\nFarmers in Iceland receive government support, and everyone has equal\r\nrights to land along with other productive resources and inputs. \r\nIceland aims to make all its food production sustainable for Icelandic\r\nfood to reflect the goals of sustainability, quality, and purity. \r\nIceland is a member of NordGen, but no laws exist on access and fair\r\ndistribution of genetic resources. \r\nMain achievements\r\nIceland’s first food strategy and action plan were published in 2020. It aims to promote increased \r\nvalue creation in food production, ensure food safety, and increase people’s well-being in harmony \r\nwith the environment and nature. \r\nAn extensive review was carried out on the provision of food aid from the country’s main domestic aid \r\norganizations and the results are being used to improve public services to ensure that the resources \r\nmeet the needs of all those in need, including low-wage workers and people of foreign origin. \r\nMain challenges\r\nIt is necessary to continue to ensure that hunger and malnutrition do not become a problem among \r\nthe poor, the elderly, and the disabled. There is also a need for further measures regarding obesity, \r\nhealth, and well-being, where physical, mental, and social factors are looked at holistically to\r\nimprove the health, well-being, and quality of life of the citizens over the long term. \r\nInternational cooperation\r\nIceland’s main objective in international development cooperation is to reduce poverty and \r\nhunger and to promote general welfare based on gender equality, human rights, and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Particular attention is paid to children’s rights and to giving them opportunities to \r\nthrive and develop their abilities. \r\nIceland supports the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF. Both organisations provide\r\nimportant nutritional assistance to developing countries and regions receiving humanitarian\r\nassistance. Iceland’s support is in the form of framework agreements and agreements on\r\nproviding Icelandic experts. Iceland also responds to emergency calls insofar as possible with \r\nemergency contributions. For example, Iceland supports a project run by WFP that gives over \r\ntwelve thousand primary school students in Malawi access to home-grown school meals. \r\nNext steps\r\n• New food, agriculture, and fisheries policies combined with action plans that focus on\r\nsustainable development. \r\n• Strategic priorities in prevention, health promotion, and treatment of obesity based on\r\nscientific knowledge. Implement actions to promote public health with an emphasis on \r\nhealthy lifestyles to reduce the health consequences of obesity. \r\nIceland has an ample supply of nutritious food. Authorities aim to ensure access for all to\r\nsafe and healthy food choices of high quality as well as to inspire sustainable practices in\r\nlocal food production.\r\n2.1\r\n2.2\r\n2.3\r\n2.4\r\n2.5\r\nDashboard Statistics\r\n2008\r\n0\r\n20\r\n40\r\n60\r\n80\r\n100\r\n120\r\n140\r\n160\r\nIndex\r\nVolume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size\r\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\r\nIceland\n\n61 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | ICELAND 2023\r\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved\r\nnutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\r\nGoal 2\r\nCivil society’s assessment\r\nÖBÍ - The Icelandic Disability Alliance, UNICEF Iceland, Icelandic Red Cross, Icelandic Church Aid - \r\nACT Alliance, The Icelandic Confederation of Labour, The Icelandic Salvation Army, and Samhjálp \r\nparticipated in this assessment. \r\nHunger, or lack of sufcient nutrition, is an issue for certain groups of people in Iceland. Although \r\ncomparatively few, the group is growing. The rise of housing prices has resulted in more of an \r\naverage person’s income goes to housing, leaving less for other necessities, including food. \r\nThe system providing food assistance is unregulated and data is lacking. However, it clear from \r\nthe data from the service providers that the number of people in Iceland who rely on food assis￾tance has multiplied since mid-2022. The recipients are people with the lowest incomes, people \r\nwith disabilities, and marginalised groups. There is a clear rise in the number of asylum seekers \r\nreceiving food aid with this group now being the majority of recipients. Food assistance is mostly \r\ndelivered by non-governmental organisations who rely on voluntary donations. Food prices are \r\nalso high in Iceland, in part due to a heavily regulated market for the production and import of \r\nagricultural products and limited competition in the grocery market. School meals are not uni￾form and difer between municipalities in terms of access and price. \r\nA food policy and strategy was recently put forth by the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries to \r\nguide improvement in this area until 2040. The policy is intended to be a guiding principle in decision \r\nmaking to increase value creation in domestic food production, ensure food security, and increase the \r\nwell-being of people in harmony with the environment and nature. The strategy focuses on sustain￾able food production, society, food security, consumer needs, research, innovation, and education. \r\nIceland should consider making school meals completely free of charge or otherwise linking them to \r\nincome to ensure equal access. The right to nutrition includes the availability of healthy food and all \r\nforms of food policies and assistance should take this into account. Food security should be increased \r\nand ensured by focussing on sustainable agriculture and increased subsidies for electricity for vegetable \r\nproduction. Food waste persists, but numerous solutions were recently formulated to limit the problem. \r\nHowever, the status of their implementation is unknown. The current agricultural system should be \r\nrevised to increase competition in the market, sustainability of the products, and lower food prices. \r\nPeople who lack food and the right nutrition certainly exist in Iceland, their needs can be met, \r\nand the issues resolved. Therefore we stress the importance of prioritising the poorest countries \r\nin the world with Iceland’s ODA to achieve SDG 2.\r\nRecommendations to the Government\r\nIeland should:\r\n• set a comprehensive policy on food assistance to ensure funding, oversight, and access.\r\nThis should include a focus on how to limit the need for food assistance in the long term\r\nin conjunction with other social policies. \r\n• monitor data on how many people need food assistance and how this assistance is best \r\nprovided. \r\n• ensure that all children receive school meals, irrespective of socio-economic background. \r\n• gather and monitor data on children’s participation in school meals. \r\n• make eforts to lower food prices. \r\n• increase support for sustainable agriculture and facilitate access for agricultural production. \r\n• regulate limitations on food waste. \r\n• ensure that 0.2% of GNI always goes to the world’s poorest countries according to the UN \r\ntarget, with a focus on climate resilient food production.",

         "24 | VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW • FIJI’S PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\nSDG 2: Zero Hunger \r\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition \r\nand promote sustainable agriculture\r\nOverview\r\nThe global indicator framework for SDGs outlines \r\n8 Targets and 13 Indicators for SDG 2. The baseline \r\ndata collected for SDGs in Fiji revealed many gaps in \r\nthe availability of data. Highlights of Fiji’s baseline \r\nstatus on nutrition are based on available data on \r\nundernourishment, stunting and malnutrition.\r\nEvery Fijian has the Constitutional Right to have access \r\nto adequate food of acceptable quality and nutritional \r\nvalue. To achieve food security in Fiji, greater emphasis \r\nis being placed on domestic agriculture and fsheries. \r\nA climate vulnerability assessment conducted in 2017 \r\nfound that between 2001 and 2017, cyclones and \r\nfloods resulted in a total of FJ$791 million in damages \r\nand losses to the agriculture sector. Recognising that \r\nclimate change is the single greatest threat to food \r\nsecurity for a small island developing state like Fiji, \r\nthe climate vulnerability assessment emphasised that \r\nan investment of about FJ$34 million is required to \r\nstrengthen the resilience of the agriculture and fsheries \r\nsectors in the next 10 years4\r\n. \r\nThe mobilisation of domestic fnance for food security \r\nand nutrition through Fiji’s annual national budgets \r\nhas increased from FJ$50.8 million in 2016-2017 to \r\nFJ$117.9 million in 2017-2018 and FJ$124.5 million \r\nin 2018-20195\r\n. Similarly, the total amount of Offcial \r\nDevelopment Assistance (ODA) for the agricultural \r\nsector has also increased from FJ$2.06 million in 2000 \r\nto FJ$17.1 million in 20166\r\n.\r\nThe Fijian undernourished population is very minute; \r\nhowever, baseline assessments reveal that it will \r\ntake Fiji several more years to fully realise SDG 2. \r\nUndernourishment cases had decreased from 5.2 \r\nper cent in 1997 to 4.2 per cent in 20067\r\n, but the \r\nprevalence of undernourishment has been increasing \r\nsince 2006, standing at 4.6 per cent in 2016. Data on \r\noverweight and wasted children under fve years of age \r\nobtained from the National Food and Nutrition Centre \r\nalso reveals a general decrease in the proportion of \r\n4 Climate Vulnerability Assessment, 2017\r\n5 National Budget Supplements, 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019\r\n6 OECD-DAC database\r\n7 Data sourced from World Bank Indicators Data Catalogue and National Food \r\nand Nutrition Center Fiji\r\nmalnourished children. Stunting is an indicator of \r\nunderweight children and is measured by low height￾for-age. Between 2004 and 2015, the proportion of \r\nstunted children under 5 years in Fiji fell from 7.5 per \r\ncent to 4.9 per cent.\r\nSeveral indicators for SDG 2 are yet to be fully achieved, \r\nand to fll these gaps, the Fijian Government – committed \r\nto ensuring Fijians get adequate and nutritious foods \r\n– is investing resources in research and development \r\nin agriculture, fsheries and food security. While under￾nutrition and micronutrient defciencies continue to \r\npersist, prevalence of overweight and obese Fijians of \r\nall ages, and as a result, related non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs) are a nationwide epidemic. The World \r\nHealth Organisation in 2016 revealed that 84 per cent of \r\ndeaths in Fiji occurred due to NCDs. Fiji must reevaluate \r\nhow malnutrition and obesity are addressed both in \r\nterms of planning and capacity implementation, while \r\nemphasising the interplay and key role of agriculture, \r\nhealth, education, trade and other sectors.\r\nThrough an aggressive marketing and branding \r\ninitiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Industry, Trade \r\n& Tourism, Fiji is increasing efforts to promote local, \r\n“Fijian-Made” and “Fijian-Grown” produce. However, to \r\nachieve food security, there is a crucial need to improve \r\neffciency at the farm level, which ultimately contributes \r\nto low commodity pricing in the market as well as the \r\nneed to improve market arrangements for primary \r\nagriculture and fsheries produce. Other innovative \r\nindustries, such as aquaculture, are being actively \r\ncultivated in Fiji’s maritime communities. \r\nOpportunities for Collaboration\r\nFiji’s development plans provide several opportunities \r\nto address SDG 2. The development of a national food \r\nand nutrition security policy is currently underway, \r\nwhich will strengthen the enabling environment and \r\nprovide a nexus for agriculture and nutrition. The policy \r\nwill allow for joint periodic agriculture and fsheries \r\ncensuses, and will strengthen statistics and information \r\ncollection through the development of a Domestic Food \r\nProduction Database (agriculture and fsheries) as \r\nwell as through the existing Food Balance Sheet and \n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW • FIJI’S PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS | 25\r\nNational Nutrition Survey8\r\n.\r\nOver the next fve years, the agriculture sector has key \r\ninterventions to increase production of commodities \r\nunder bilateral quarantine agreements (such as \r\neggplant, okra, pawpaw, chillies, and breadfruit), as well \r\nas rice, taro, cassava, fruits and vegetables, kava, organic \r\nproducts, livestock and dairy products. Mechanisation \r\nand new technologies will be adopted through \r\ngovernment support and private sector partnerships, \r\nparticularly for hydroponics, livestock and dairy, organic \r\nfarming, and processing of agricultural products (e.g. \r\nginger, rice, fresh fruits and vegetables and fruit drinks).\r\nTo improve food security in the fsheries sector, the Fijian \r\nGovernment plans to address existing development \r\nchallenges such as falling fsh stocks, slow growth in \r\naquaculture, weak value-addition for fsheries resources, \r\nand the negative effects of climate change. The soon￾to-be-completed National Fisheries Policy will guide the \r\nmanagement and development of offshore, inshore/ \r\ncoastal and aquaculture activities, with a long-term \r\nfocus on sustainable management of existing offshore \r\nand inshore/coastal resources while supporting further \r\ngrowth in aquaculture.\r\n8 Fiji 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan.(2017-2036)",

         "14\r\nAccording to the OECD \r\nBetter Life index, Belgium \r\nranks above average in work￾life balance as well as in \r\nsubjective well-being and \r\nhealth status. The 2017 \r\nWorld Happiness Report \r\nranked Belgium 17th, one place up compared to the previous \r\nedition. When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life \r\non a scale from 0 to 10, Belgians gave it a 6.9 grade, higher \r\nthan the OECD average of 6.5. In terms of health, life \r\nexpectancy at birth in Belgium is 81 years (for women it is \r\n83 years, compared to 78 for men). A large part (78%) of the \r\nBelgian population reports to be in good health, which is a \r\nbetter result than the EU-15 average. Belgians also report to \r\nbe satisfied with the health care system. Infants receiving the \r\n8 WHO vaccines rate at 96%. In Belgium, over one in four \r\npeople over the age of 15 indicate that they suffer from at least \r\none chronic illness. Compared to other EU member states, the \r\ncountry has a relatively high depression rate. The figures \r\nconcerning suicide are decreasing, but remain high. \r\nThe combination of chronic care, ageing and the up-take in \r\nnew technologies challenges the guaranteed sustainable \r\nfinancing base of the welfare and health care system, where \r\nclear arrangements on basic financing mechanisms and \r\nsolidarity exist.\r\nGovernment priorities relate to addressing non-communica￾ble diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, \r\nchronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and mental illness – \r\nwhich are the leading causes of mortality. Efforts to prevent \r\nthese focus on tackling four major risk behaviors – smoking \r\n(18.1% daily smokers 10, indicator 6 in the annex), alcohol \r\nabuse (9% of the adult population consumes too much alco￾hol) 11, unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles – and are based \r\non an integrated horizontal approach targeted at health pro￾motion, prevention and early detection, involving all relevant \r\npolicy makers and stakeholders.\r\nReducing deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents is a \r\nfocus area of specific importance. In 2015, Belgium registered \r\n65 such deaths per 1 million. This is already a significant im￾provement compared with the 1994 figure of 167. According \r\nto the latest assessment in 2016, there were 13% less traffic \r\nrelated deaths in comparison to 2015. The number of injuries \r\ndropped with 1.4%. These figures have never been better, but \r\nwork remains to be done in order to achieve the objective of \r\nan absolute number of maximum 420 deaths from traffic \r\naccidents by 2020. As 70% of all traffic victims are male, \r\nspecific attention also needs to go to this category.\r\nWhen it comes to addressing the health related issues in the \r\nBelgian international development efforts 12, a rights-based ap￾proach is the point of departure. Preference is given to strength￾ening health systems and to integrating health services within \r\nan effective system that enhances the quality and the resilience \r\nof these services. Major policy priorities in this context are the \r\nfight against communicable and non-communicable diseases \r\nas well as the promotion of sexual and reproductive health \r\nand rights.\r\nA joint plan concluded between all Belgian governments \r\naims at improving chronically ill persons’ quality of life 13\r\nin their own environments (family, school, workplace) and \r\nin their communities, so they can actively manage their \r\ncare trajectory. Further tweaks to the health care system \r\nare foreseen and indeed necessary in order to improve \r\nthe general population’s state of health and the chron￾ically ill’s specifically. They are also needed to improve \r\nthe quality of the care provided, in terms of accessibility \r\nSDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote \r\nwell-being for all at all ages\r\n10 A steady and firm decrease from 23,5 in 2000 to 18,1 % in 2015, with significant difference between men (22%) and women (16%). 11 Significant gender differences exist, with about 15% of the male population consuming too much alcohol against 6% of the female population. 12 The sector represented 146.7 million EUR, or over 7% of our ODA commitments in 2016 (est.). 13 Integrated Care for Better Health.\n\n15\r\nand evidence base, and to obtain efficiency gains within \r\nthe assigned means (better care and its financial sustain￾ability). In addition, several other plans focus on specific \r\ndiseases such as Alzheimer and autism 14.The Walloon \r\nHealth Observatory, through the analysis of socio-sanitary \r\ndata, currently studies (2015-2019) mental and primary \r\nhealth care, population ageing, the quality of hospital care \r\nand health promotion. Gender and social health-relat￾ed inequalities are cross-cutting points of attention in \r\nthese efforts. Wallonia also works on a future Health and \r\nPrevention 2030 Plan 15 with five priority areas: promo￾tion of safety measures and of healthy life styles (inter alia\r\nthrough food, physical exercise and combating excessive \r\nalcohol and tobacco consumption), promotion of mental \r\nhealth and general well-being, and prevention of chronical \r\nillnesses, of infectious diseases and of non-intentional \r\ntraumas (3.4). Measures against HIV and aids, Hepatitis C \r\nor TB are furthermore coordinated within specific plans. \r\nThe one on HIV (2014-2019) contains 58 actions to curb \r\nthe number of new HIV infections, to further improve \r\naccess to HIV-specialized prevention, detection, care and \r\nquality assistance services and programs, and to bring \r\ndown all forms of stigma and discrimination, especially \r\nwhen they are based on serological or health status (3.3).\r\nIn the field of mental health care Belgium has shifted from \r\ntraditional, large psychiatric institutions to a modern, inclu￾sive care system with increased focus on the community, \r\nestablishing inter alia multidisciplinary outreach teams \r\nthat provide to people with mental health conditions, who \r\ntraditionally would have been hospitalized, the opportu￾nity to choose where they wish to receive treatment and \r\ncare. The treatment and care provided by these teams \r\nhave shown to prevent long-term hospitalization. Through \r\nthe recently approved Federal Masterplan on internment \r\n(2016) Belgium is also stepping up its action on forensic \r\npsychiatric treatment and care, increasing the capacity of \r\nspecialized centers as well as facilitating access for intern￾ees to conventional and regular care in view of optimizing \r\nre-integration into society (3.4).\r\nAs sports have a beneficial effect on physical and mental \r\nhealth alike, Flemish policies attach importance to this \r\nnotion 16 through a series of sports after school and sports \r\nat work related actions. A campaign 17 inciting less active \r\ncitizens to develop more active life styles is part and parcel \r\nof the same effort. By integrating sport as a tool in the \r\nfight against obesity and inactivity, the French-speaking \r\nCommunity promotes health enhancing physical activity \r\n(HEPA) policies across sectors and as a partner in regional \r\nhealth promotion plans (3.4).\r\nIn terms of alcohol policies, measures taken by the various \r\nBelgian governments include stricter oversight on adver￾tisements for alcohol containing products, higher fines for \r\ntrampling with advertising rules, awareness-raising cam￾paigns and training programs for care deliverers regarding \r\nalcohol use by pregnant women, and an excise increase on \r\nalcoholic drinks. Meanwhile, a pilot project focuses on de￾tection of and intervention upon alcohol problems among \r\nemergency warden patients in eight hospitals. A series of \r\ninitiatives particularly targets young persons (16-18 age \r\nrange), including clarifying legal provisions, strengthening \r\nand intensifying control measures on vending machines \r\nwith alcoholic beverages, and launching discussions be￾tween alcohol producers and retail sellers in order to \r\nobtain an agreement on voluntary labelling of minimum \r\nage. When it comes to smoking, governments are taking \r\nseveral steps: awareness raising, labels and warnings, reg￾ulating the sale and advertising of tobacco products, and a \r\nsmoking ban in publicly accessible places. New measures to \r\ndiscourage and decrease tobacco use as from 2016 include \r\na ban on internet sales, a legal framework on e-cigarettes \r\nand even more visible health warnings (3.5).\r\nRoad traffic safety policies are being developed among var￾ious actors and stakeholders. At the federal level, the so￾called States General on Road Traffic Safety in 2015 spelled \r\nout 20 recommendations, which were an inspiration for \r\nmany actions taken since then, such as efforts to simplify \r\ntraffic rules, to better execute traffic fines, to make an \r\n14 Plan Autisme 2016. 15 Plan Prévention Santé Horizon 2030. 16 “Bewegen op Verwijzing” (“Exercise per Medical Certificate”). 17 #sportersbelevenmeer.\n\n16\r\nalcolock mandatory in passenger vehicles and for repeat \r\noffenders, to increase objective and subjective probability \r\nof detection through the use of a reliable and continuously \r\nupdated database, and to improve the quality of alcohol \r\nand drugs screenings. At the Flemish level 18, policy rec￾ommendations are centered around the 4E’s: Education & \r\nAwareness, Engineering, Enforcement, Evaluation. These \r\nrecommendations have been taken on board when a road \r\nsafety plan (2015) 19 and a cycling policy plan (2016) 20\r\nwere developed, with a focus on awareness-raising, infor￾mation and sensitization on safe traffic behavior. A specific \r\nprogram21 confronts 17 year olds with the testimonies \r\nby road traffic victims on their lives before and after the \r\naccident. The Walloon Government promotes safe road \r\nbehavior through awareness-raising campaigns for the \r\nwider audience as well as specific categories of road users. \r\nParents associations of children who were victims of traffic \r\naccidents lobby the political world in order to impact both \r\nroad safety and the environment through imposing certain \r\nbasic limits in terms of motor vehicle features (3.6).\r\nAccess to quality health care services in Flanders is being \r\nensured through a wide range of measures such as making \r\nprimary care services more accessible 22, enlarging the \r\nscope of the Flemish Social Protection in order to bet￾ter insure people against long-term care needs, paying \r\nspecial attention to persons with disabilities, adopting \r\nan action plan on youth assistance, and creating ‘Houses \r\nof the Child’. Flanders Care acts as a catalyzer for system \r\ninnovation in the organization of care services, putting the \r\npatient central stage and adapting the services offered to \r\nsociety’s needs. This also answers to the (youth, elderly) \r\npopulation’s changing needs in terms of care. Accessi￾bility is also one of the principal objectives of a Patients’ \r\nFuture Pact 23 agreed between the federal government \r\nand the pharmaceutical industry. Other measures aim to \r\nimprove access to care for a series of particularly vulner￾able groups (such as detainees, low income households, \r\nhomeless people, newly-arrived immigrants, sex workers, \r\ndrug users, people with mental disorders) which tend to \r\nhave only weak links with standard medical care, guided \r\nby the operational recommendations which were formu￾lated by the National Institute for Health and Disability \r\nInsurance 24. Focusing specifically on high quality child \r\ncare and well-being, the Office for Birth and Childhood 25\r\nof the French-speaking Community provides prenatal \r\nand childhood consultations, mobile clinics, vaccination \r\nprograms, free medical consultations and home visits, thus \r\nsupporting both children and their parents, medically as \r\nwell as socially (3.8).\r\nRegarding the health and environment nexus, a coherent \r\napproach is ensured through the Joint Inter-Ministerial \r\nConference on Environment and Health (JICEH), bringing \r\ntogether the responsible ministers from the three levels of \r\ngovernment. The National Health and Environment Action \r\nPlan (2009-2017) focuses inter alia on human biomoni￾toring (in the context of EU research on actual exposure \r\nof citizens to chemicals and the possible health effects), \r\ntraining for environmental health professionals, ozone \r\nand particulate matter, presence of exotic mosquitos, and \r\npersistent organic pollutants (POPs) in human milk. A new \r\nFlemish air quality plan is being prepared, based on the \r\nevaluation of the previous one (2012-2015). Wallonia \r\nhas set up its own environment and health policy cell that \r\nhas been working out several plans that should improve \r\nthe Walloons’ environment and hence their health and \r\nwell-being – on air, climate and energy 26, radon 27, on de￾creasing the use of pesticides 28, POPs 29, heat waves and \r\n18 Vlaams Huis van de Verkeersveiligheid (Flemish House for Road Safety).\r\n19 Verkeersveiligheidsplan.\r\n20 Vlaams Fietsbeleidsplan.\r\n21 Verkeersgetuigen/Getuigen onderweg.\r\n22 “Breed Onthaal”.\r\n23 Pacte d’Avenir pour le Patient.\r\n24 RIZIV/INAMI White paper on Access to Care in Belgium (2014). 25 Office de la Naissance et de l’Enfance.\r\n26 Plan Air Climat Energie 2016-2022. 27 Plan d’actions régional en matière de Radon (2013). 28 Programme wallon de réduction des pesticides (2013-2017). 29 Plan POP.\n\n17\r\nozone peaks 30, and on regional actions that link health and \r\nenvironment 31 (3.9). \r\nBelgium has been at the very cutting-edge of pharmaceu￾tical innovation for over 150 years. It has developed five \r\nof the global top-100 drugs, the world’s highest number \r\nper capita, and its pharmaceutical companies also tend to \r\nperform well in their efforts to improve access to medi￾cines for people living in low- and middle-income countries. \r\nWith medicines taking up around a tenth in its total ex￾ports, Belgium is also the largest provider of vaccines and \r\nmedicines to the UN system. More generally speaking, \r\nwithin the 14% of funds allocated by the Belgian devel￾opment cooperation to the health sector, 22% are consti￾tuted by the provision of medicines, which is an especially \r\ninteresting figure given that Belgium also has one of the \r\nmost stringent legislations on the quality of vaccines and \r\nmedicines destined for exports. A new initiative, rolled out \r\nin 2017, seeks to ensure the quality of all pharmaceutical \r\nproducts purchased, stored and/or distributed by Belgian \r\nactors, governmental and non-governmental alike, through \r\nBelgian ODA financing. Moreover, Belgium has acceded to \r\nthe recently created Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness \r\nInnovations (CEPI), a global alliance which intends to step \r\nup the fight against fatal infectious diseases in the coming \r\nyears by making vaccines for emerging infectious diseases \r\navailable more quickly (3.b).\r\nBelgium is strongly committed to strengthening health \r\nsystems through its international cooperation, following \r\na rights-based, sector-wide approach that ensures \r\nintegration within local systems. The World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO), UNAIDS, the Global Fund to fight \r\nAids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and the UN \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) are institutional partners of \r\nour development cooperation. When it comes to capacity \r\nbuilding (3.c, 3.d), the internationally renowned Institute \r\nof Tropical Medicine (ITM) is a partner of choice for \r\nfederal and subnational authorities alike: it twins with \r\nsouthern counterparts in order to introduce evidence￾based medicine models, it applies a Switching the Poles \r\ndemand-driven assistance methodology in its training \r\nprograms for southern physicians, and it organizes crash \r\ncourses for southern medical experts preparing them for \r\nmultilateral negotiations in their field. \r\nOn early warning (3.d), Belgian development actors are \r\nworking with various research partners on dynamic pre￾dictive mapping in the field of communicable diseases, \r\nnotably through a demonstration project for the malaria \r\nvector habitat in South East Asia, and through efforts to \r\nadapt this approach to other vector-borne diseases than \r\nmalaria (such as dengue fever). Belgian health experts par￾ticipate in countries’ external evaluations in the framework \r\nof the 2005 International Health Regulation, and our own \r\nBelgian system and procedures in that regard will be crit￾ically assessed in the course of 2017. Belgium recent￾ly awarded new state-to-state loans, soft loans, mixed \r\ncredits and grants to projects in Kenya (bacteriological \r\ndecontamination of hospital waste, and clinical laboratory \r\nand radiology services improvement), Vietnam and Egypt \r\n(supplying nuclear medicine machinery), Ghana (supply￾ing diagnostic radiology related material) and Mongolia \r\n(medical equipment to a diagnostic and medical center). \r\nIn terms of management of global health risks, our country \r\n- through development cooperation as well as initiatives \r\nby civil society, the ITM and the private sector - took a \r\nforefront role in helping to contain the most recent glob￾al ebola outbreaks and in assisting the directly affected \r\ncountries 32, putting emphasis on innovation and on the \r\nassociation of strategies strenghtening mutual trust be￾tween communities and health services.\r\nBelgium is equally dedicated to the promotion of sexual \r\nand reproductive health and rights (3.7), inter alia in the \r\ncontext of the relevant UN fora such as the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the Commission on the Status of Women or the \r\nCommission on Population and Development. We host￾ed a highly successful international conference for the \r\nGlobal Fundraising Initiative She Decides in March 2017 \r\n30 Plan vagues de chaleur et pics d’ozone (2008). 31 Programme d’actions régionales environnement santé (PARES) (2008). 32 Guinea, for example, became a new partner country for our bilateral development cooperation in 2015.\n\n18\r\n(see SDG 5 for discussion in more detail). The Belgian \r\nmulti-stakeholder platform for international health \r\n(Be-cause Health) 33 and the ITM developed a freely \r\naccessible e-tutorial covering a wide range of topics in \r\nthe field of sexual and reproductive health and rights \r\nsuch as safe motherhood, sexual violence, child mar￾riage, female genital mutilation, HIV, sexually trans￾mitted infections, family planning and sexual rights. \r\nThe Flemish government is dedicating a large part of its \r\ndevelopment cooperation in Mozambique to this particu￾lar subsector and provides support to the UNDP/UN￾FPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme \r\nfor Research, Development and Research Training in \r\nHuman Reproduction (HRP) 34.\r\nThe Belgian commitment in terms of fighting maternal \r\nmortality (3.1) plays out mainly in sub-Saharan African \r\npartner countries of our bilateral development coopera￾tion. Focal areas include the skilling of medical personnel \r\nin emergency obstetric care, decentralization of blood \r\ntransfusion, and capacity building for rural health centers \r\nboth in terms of surgery competences (including caesarian \r\nsection skills) as well as in upgrading ambulance services. \r\nIn countries such as Senegal, there has been a significant \r\nuptake in the 2012-2015 period in the intervention areas \r\nof Belgian projects, in terms of coverage (new ailments \r\ntreated, +49%) and of professionally assisted deliveries \r\n(+37%).\r\nEnding communicable and neglected tropical diseases \r\n(NTDs) (3.3) was and is high on Belgium’s priority list. \r\nBelgium joined the international coalition to control, elim￾inate and eradicate 10 NTDs. Building on its widely rec￾ognized expertise in fighting sleeping disease in the DRC, \r\nthrough a decentralized approach integrating sleeping \r\ndisease surveillance activities within our support to local \r\nhealth systems Belgium will allocate 25,3 million EUR over \r\nthe next nine years, in a decisive push to eliminate sleeping \r\nsickness by 2025. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \r\nhas committed to match Belgium’s contribution. Other \r\nInitiatives range from general support for UNAIDS (its first \r\nexecutive director was Belgian) and CSOs that are assist￾ing in setting up HIV positive patient groups in Southern \r\nAfrican countries, to sustained action campaigns against \r\ntuberculosis and leprosy. \r\nAt the multilateral level, Belgium supports the mandate \r\nand work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right of \r\neveryone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable stand￾ard of physical and mental health (3.4, 3.5). Mental health \r\nis a special focus area of HM Queen Mathilde, one of the \r\n17 SDG Advocates, and is also taken at heart in our efforts \r\nabroad. In Rwanda, Belgium has been the principal donor \r\nto fight mental health problems including substance abuse \r\nnationwide for nearly a decade and we helped establishing \r\na national policy on the matter. \r\nBelgian development actors consider mutual health \r\ninsurance schemes as a key component of achieving \r\nuniversal health coverage (3.8) given their role as \r\nimportant mechanisms to improve governance issues \r\nin the health sector, access and quality care as well as \r\npatients’ rights and equity. Facilitating better sharing of \r\nexpertise and experiences in order to overcome purely \r\nsectoral approaches, actions in this area are supported \r\nin Uganda, Benin, Burundi, Rwanda, Senegal and Niger. \r\n33 http://www.be-causehealth.be/en/who-are-we/ 34 Currently, the Flemish representative is also Chair of HRP’s Executive Board.",

         "From Agenda to Action — 31\r\nHealth and welfare promotion (HYTE) involves pre￾ventive support and activities carried out jointly by all \r\nof the City’s operators, based on sustainable devel￾opment, to boost the resources of diferent popula￾tion groups. Health and welfare promotion is one of \r\nHelsinki’s key actions to promote social sustainability. \r\nThe main objective is to reduce disparities in health \r\nand welfare. The work infuences the comfort of life \r\nof the city’s residents, improves their perceived well￾being, quality of life and health and ensures that their \r\neveryday environments support a good and physically \r\nactive life. The systematic promotion of health and \r\nwelfare creates beter opportunities for agency, hope, \r\nsecurity and a beter future. Based on research and \r\nexperience, the work has identifed the challenges \r\nin the wellbeing of the city’s residents that require \r\nadditional investment. \r\nDuring the current council term, the city \r\nresidents’ mental wellbeing, healthy lifestyles and \r\neveryday physical activity, as well as opportuni￾ties for meaningful recreation and leisure, will be \r\nstrengthened. By investing in the regional strength￾ening of good community relations, the inclusion \r\nand safety of residents in their own neighbour￾hoods is expected to improve. Furthermore, \r\nseveral projects are underway to help residents \r\nenjoy their daily lives in a safe and beautiful city.\r\nAs part of the implementation of the work on \r\nhealth and welfare promotion, the City Council \r\nadopted the City of Helsinki Welfare Plan in No￾vember 2022, the contents of which promote the \r\nobjectives of social sustainability by addressing \r\nwellbeing challenges identifed on the basis of \r\nresearch data.\r\nHealth and welfare\r\nFrom Agenda to Action — 31\n\nFrom Agenda to Action — 32\r\nCity residents face diverse wellbeing \r\nchallenges\r\nAn individual’s experience of their health and wellbe￾ing afects their resources and also refects on e.g. \r\nquality of life, social relationships, activity in society \r\nand ability to manage in everyday life. Mental well￾being challenges experienced by children and young \r\npeople and psychological strain among the adult \r\npopulation are more common in Helsinki than in the \r\ncountry as a whole. Around one in ten people aged \r\n75 and over feel depressed or mentally strained and \r\n14 per cent feel lonely. The level of anxiety experi￾enced by girls in particular has also increased in \r\nrecent years, as has the loneliness experienced by \r\nyoung people. Regular hobbies and recreational op￾portunities foster wellbeing in many ways. According \r\nto a recent study, children in Helsinki with a weekly \r\nhobby experience less loneliness, school stress, \r\nsleep difculties, mood swings and school bullying \r\nthan others.\r\nThe majority of the adult population are hap￾py and feel that their quality of life and health are \r\ngood, but there are nevertheless diferences in their \r\nexperiences of quality of life, health and happiness \r\ndepending on perceived income adequacy. These \r\ndiferences may, in turn, be refected in diferenc￾es between population groups in lifestyles, mental \r\nwellbeing or morbidity. There is signifcant variation \r\nin the prevalence of morbidity and public diseases \r\nbetween the districts of Helsinki. The social chal￾lenges and unhealthy lifestyles underlying morbidity \r\nare concentrated on residents who are already in a \r\nvulnerable position.\r\nLifestyle greatly infuences health and wellbeing. \r\nIn addition to physical inactivity, obesity, smoking \r\nand alcohol abuse are all linked to morbidity and re￾duced capacity to work. Perceived income adequacy \r\nhas a connection to physical activity, i.e. young\r\npeople who feel very good about their family’s eco￾nomic situation and residents who fnd it easy \r\nor quite easy to make a living are physically more \r\nactive than the other population groups.\r\nHelsinki’s population is increasingly diverse. \r\nAlongside the increasing diversity of lifestyles, \r\nlinguistic diversity is also growing, and the num￾ber of older people is increasing along with young \r\nage groups. There are diferences in residents’ \r\nconcerns about safety between various parts of \r\nHelsinki. In areas where experiences of insecurity \r\nare more prevalent, there are particular concerns \r\nabout people’s misbehaviour, street violence, crime, \r\ndrug use and dealing as well as conficts between \r\ndiferent language and cultural groups. On average, \r\nthe participation of Helsinki residents is at a strong \r\nlevel, but there are also clear diferences in partic￾ipation between population groups and by neigh￾bourhood. Children and young people’s experiences \r\nof inclusion have deteriorated and the gender gap in \r\nwellbeing has increased.\r\nSafe, beautiful and functional everyday environ￾ments form the basis of the wellbeing and health \r\nof the city’s residents. As safety improves, people’s \r\nphysical, mental and social health, wellbeing and \r\nquality of life are strengthened. Everyday environ￾ments refer to people’s homes, the surrounding en￾vironment and yard areas, the broader urban space \r\nand structure, and nature. This means that both the \r\ndevelopment of the broader urban structure and the \r\npromotion of safe living in the home environment are \r\nkey to promoting health and welfare. Urban nature \r\nand green spaces also have a signifcant positive \r\nimpact on health and wellbeing.\r\nThere is strong evidence of the positive efects \r\nof culture on wellbeing, health, social interaction and \r\nother resources. Participation in art activities as an \r\nexperiencer or creator can prevent numerous men￾tal and physical illnesses, as well as treat and help \r\ncope with a range of acute and chronic illnesses. \r\nMaking and experiencing art strengthens the skills \r\nto navigate in a changing world: curiosity, compas￾sion, interaction skills, the ability to see things difer￾ently and the courage to seek new directions. \r\nAddressing wellbeing challenges \r\nthrough City-wide development work\r\nThe mental wellbeing of the city’s residents is \r\nstrengthened by developing diferent forms of early \r\nsupport, such as beter identifcation of mental \r\nhealth problems in children and young people, in￾cluding through the Common Approach (CA) mod￾el, children’s emotional and interaction skills, youth \r\nwork in schools, communality and peer support.\r\nThe recreational activities of children and \r\nyoung people in particular are being strengthened. \r\nThe Finnish model for leisure activities in Helsinki \r\nofers free hobbies in all comprehensive schools in \r\nHelsinki. The activities have been made permanent \r\nand included in the Youth Act. The model aims to \r\nreach especially those children and young people \r\nwho do not have hobbies. The Culture Kids activ￾ities are continued by including a new age group \r\nevery year. For older people, cultural instructor \r\nactivities and companion activities are developed. \r\nVolunteering and peer activities and cooperation \r\nwith organisations is developed extensively. \n\nFrom Agenda to Action — 33\r\nPhysical activity is promoted through coop￾eration between divisions, targeting the least \r\nactive population groups and raising awareness of \r\nopportunities for physical activity and exercise for \r\nall residents. Physical activity is promoted in every \r\nearly childhood education unit, comprehensive \r\nschool and upper secondary school. Methods \r\nand tools for bringing up physical activity are de￾veloped extensively in health and social services. \r\nThe workplace and mental wellbeing of City \r\nemployees is strengthened by increasing oppor￾tunities for physical activity. The status of physical \r\nactivity is strengthened in the care culture of hos￾pital, rehabilitation and nursing services by means \r\nof a mobility agreement. The exercise and physical \r\nactivity of older people is promoted in cooperation \r\nbetween the City’s operators, organisations \r\nand companies. \r\nThe implementation of healthy lifestyles is \r\npromoted through means such as nutrition train￾ing for professionals and the use of digital tools. \r\nWellbeing cafés are organised for children and \r\nyoung people, and the use of the Finger operating \r\nmodel for older people is strengthened. Develop￾ment related to memory-friendliness is also being \r\nstrengthened during the council term. Substance \r\nabuse prevention methods are strengthened \r\nthrough measures targeted at diferent population \r\ngroups, and the service chain for substance \r\nabuse and addiction in families with children \r\nis developed.\r\nGood community relations are promoted by \r\nincreasing interaction between individuals and \r\ninfuencing people’s sense of security and atitudes. \r\nThe pluralism of residents and their equal oppor￾tunities for participation and infuence have been \r\nstrengthened, anti-polarising approaches have been \r\nintroduced in youth work, and City employees have \r\nbeen trained in the use of dialogical, constructive \r\ndiscussion methods, which have been used in the \r\ndiscussion of controversial issues or those that are \r\nof concern to a wide audience, such as changes in \r\nservices. In Helsinki’s participatory budgeting OmaS￾tadi, the participation of population groups identifed \r\nas underrepresented in previous rounds is promoted \r\nat all stages of the process, equality is supported and \r\nmulti-channel communication is strengthened, taking \r\ninto account diferent population groups and city dis￾tricts. The children’s rights perspective is addressed \r\nthrough UNICEF’s Child Friendly Cities work. \r\nResidents’ daily environments are infuenced \r\nby identifying and addressing safety challenges in \r\ndiferent neighbourhoods. Planning guidelines for \r\nthe walking environment and the improvement of the \r\nsafety of pedestrian crossings promote safe mobil￾ity in urban areas. The Percentage for Art principle \r\ngives city residents the opportunity to experience and \r\nencounter art in their neighbourhoods. Furthermore, \r\nthe City addresses the increasing violence in close \r\nrelationships and local factors that undermine safety, \r\nand raises awareness among residents about the \r\nsafety of their homes and neighbourhoods. \r\nFrom Agenda to Action — 33\n\nFrom Agenda to Action — 34\r\nSuccesses:\r\n• The majority of Helsinki residents feel that their \r\nquality of life and health is good and are happy.\r\n• Service chain work has been launched in mental \r\nhealth services for children and young people, \r\nin substance abuse and mental health work for \r\nolder people, and with families experiencing vio￾lence in close relationships.\r\n• Common Approach training for mental wellbeing \r\nhas been launched in the divisions. In addition \r\nto this, several other training programmes for \r\nmental wellbeing skills are underway.\r\n• The Finnish model for leisure activities has been \r\nestablished and ofers free hobbies in all com￾prehensive schools in Helsinki. Hobby groups \r\ncurrently reach around 30% of the target group.\r\n• More than 7,000 upper secondary level \r\nstudents have been reached through the \r\nLiikuntacoach activities.\r\n• There is a growing understanding of the \r\nimportance of daily physical activity. Hundreds \r\nof thousands of Helsinki residents have been \r\nreached through campaigns, events, \r\nwebsites and materials.\r\nAreas for development:\r\n• With the exception of young children, the \r\naverage Helsinki resident engages in too litle \r\nphysical activity and is too sedentary for their \r\nhealth, compared to national recommendations \r\nfor physical activity.\r\n• There are diferences in quality of life, health \r\nand happiness depending on perceived income \r\nadequacy. \r\n• Mental wellbeing challenges and increased lone￾liness experienced by children and young people, \r\nas well as psychological strain among the adult \r\npopulation, are more common in Helsinki than in \r\nthe country as a whole, and there are still chal￾lenges in the development of early support.\r\n• There is signifcant variation in the prevalence \r\nof morbidity and public diseases between the \r\ndistricts of Helsinki. Digital self-care services for \r\nthe city’s residents need to be improved to beter \r\nreach the residents.\r\n• Children and young people’s experiences of \r\ninclusion have deteriorated and the gender gap in \r\nwellbeing has increased.\r\n• Despite the numerous measures taken, excess \r\nweight and obesity have not decreased in Hel￾sinki. Excess weight is a signifcant challenge in \r\nterms of public health. \r\n• There are projects, experiments and good prac￾tices, but there are challenges in geting them \r\nestablished.\r\nProgrammes, studies and websites: \r\nHealth and welfare promotion website\r\nWell-being, Health and Safety for Everyone – \r\nThe City of Helsinki Welfare Plan 2022–2025\r\nPDF \r\nAnnual monitoring reports of the City of \r\nHelsinki Welfare Plan\n\nFrom Agenda to Action — 35\r\nPhysical activity of older people \r\nat the centre of the City’s wellbeing \r\nwork 2021–2023 \r\nPhysical activity is particularly important for maintain￾ing health and functional capacity as we age. How￾ever, studies show that the majority of older people \r\ndo not engage in enough physical activity for their \r\nhealth. Helsinki has recognised that a much broad￾er approach than just ftness exercise is needed to \r\nincrease the physical activity of older people and \r\nimprove their opportunities for physical activity. \r\nIn 2021, the physical activity of older people was \r\nmade a common budgetary objective for the City’s \r\nhealth and welfare promotion, and this City-wide \r\nobjective continued in 2022 and 2023. All of the City’s \r\ndivisions play a role in promoting older people’s \r\nphysical activity. The objective of the cooperation is \r\nto remove obstacles to the everyday physical activ￾ity of older people, the most important of which are \r\nthe accessibility of the environment, accessibility of \r\nservices and mobility challenges, but also loneliness \r\nand lack of social support. A signifcant proportion of \r\nolder people cannot easily fnd information on existing \r\nservices to support their wellbeing. \r\nSince 2021, dozens of measures have been taken \r\nin the divisions to promote older people’s physical \r\nactivity. Concrete examples of these measures in the \r\nUrban Environment Division include an increase in \r\nthe number of street and park benches by more than \r\n400, improved conditions for walking and cycling and \r\nenhanced winter maintenance.\r\nIn the Social Services and Health Care Division, \r\nthe use of the mobility agreement has expanded to \r\nall hospital, care and rehabilitation services, with the \r\ntotal utilisation rate exceeding 70%. Bringing up phys￾ical activity and advice on physical activity have been \r\nincreased in Senior Info, and remote services that \r\npromote physical activity have been produced exten￾sively in the Social Services and Health Care Division \r\nand the Culture and Leisure Division. Dance and exer￾cise courses for older people have been organised at \r\nthe adult education centres Työväenopisto and Arbis, \r\nand their number will be increased in 2023. \r\nIn 2021 and 2022, a total of 3.4 million euros was \r\ndistributed to dozens of organisations and associa￾tions to promote physical activity and culture to older \r\npeople in Helsinki. The ‘Anna arjen liikutaa’ com￾munication campaign in 2021 reached an estimated \r\n100,000 Helsinki residents.\r\nLibraries have been supplied with 30 senior ex￾ercise equipment bags available for loan, and several \r\ndozen peer instructors in physical activity for older \r\npeople have been trained. Instructed physical activity \r\nfor older people has been developed in cooperation \r\nwith Sports Services, service centres, Työväenopisto \r\nand Urheiluhallit Oy since 2021. \r\nThe City’s ‘Culture and leisure for the elderly’ web \r\npages published in early 2023 facilitate access to \r\ninformation on the various leisure services.\r\nIt is necessary to continue working to improve \r\nolder people’s opportunities for physical activity \r\nacross the City’s divisions.\r\nFrom Agenda to Action — 35",

From Primary to Secondary Education in St. \r\nMaarten, basic education is, in principle, free for all. The subsidy \r\nframework was expanded to include personnel costs for \r\nteachers, educational assistants, and specialists that are needed \r\nto support students and the delivery of education. It was also \r\nexpanded to make provision of funding to facilitate in-service \r\ntraining, and the provision of funds for maintenance of \r\neducational materials and buildings was decentralized. Funds \r\nare budgeted annually to enable all schools to be adequately \r\nmaintained. In addition, in 2017, the Ministry of Education, \r\nCulture, Youth, and Sport established the Higher Education \r\nPolicy, which defined the strategic direction for the further \r\ndevelopment of Higher Education in St. Maarten. The policy \r\ndetailed the basic quality standards that would be required and \r\nstrategies to enhance access for all persons who meet the \r\nrequired standards and are desirous of pursuing Higher \r\nEducation and highlighted the need for Higher Education \r\nPrograms to be developed in tandem with the local labor market \r\nneeds. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education also started the \r\nprocess developing the Special Needs Policy. Significant steps \r\nhave been made toward establishing a framework that will be \r\nused to meet the needs of students with Special Educational \r\nNeeds throughout the education system.\r\nConstruction of the hospital \n\n101 KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS - VNR 2022",

         "5.4. SDG 4. ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND PROMOTE LIFELONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES \r\nFOR ALL\r\nTurkey has in recent years made \r\nsignificant progress in access to \r\neducation and increase in the quality \r\nof education via improved teachers’ \r\nqualifications. In the education system, \r\na transformational programme is \r\nimplemented to develop personalities \r\nand abilities of individuals through equal \r\nopportunities.\r\nEnsuring access to inclusive and quality education based on \r\nequal opportunities and lifelong learning facilities is one of the \r\nmost important policies in achieving all SDGs, namely reducing \r\npoverty, qualified employment, and realising economic growth.\r\nPOLICIES\r\nIn addition to NDPs and strategic plans of relevant public \r\ninstitutions, key policy documents on SDG 4 include MoNE \r\nStrategy and Action Plan, Lifelong Learning Strategy, \r\nVocational and Technical Education Strategy and Action Plan, \r\nVision 2023, Teacher Strategy, and National Employment \r\nStrategy and Action Plan. \r\nThe key components of the policy framework in line with SDG 4 \r\nare as follows:\r\n• Increasing the schooling rate at all levels of education,\r\n• Ensuring access to school and equal opportunities in \r\neducation for all children, particularly for those with \r\ndisabilities and girls,\r\n• Enhancing the quality in education, especially in the fields of \r\nteacher qualifications, educational environment, curricula, \r\nand institutional capacity,\r\n• Ensuring the integration of technology with education,\r\n• Expanding and implementing preschool education with a \r\nholistic approach,\r\n• Meeting physical infrastructure and teacher needs in \r\npreschool education,\r\n• Developing vocational education programmes of such \r\nquality and type as needed by the labour market, and adjust \r\nthe content of secondary and higher education accordingly,\r\n• Focusing on applied training in raising skilled labour force,\r\n• Increasing skill-building and vocational activities,\r\n• Maintaining a quality-focused transformation process based \r\non equal opportunities that strengthens the coherence with \r\nthe labour market in the framework of lifelong learning \r\napproach,\r\n• Increasing lifelong learning opportunities for vulnerable \r\nsegments,\r\n• Preventing early dropouts in education, reduce absenteeism, \r\nand ensure individuals out of education return to education,\r\n• Strengthening human and physical infrastructure to ensure \r\nthat persons with disabilities in need of special education \r\nand gifted individuals receive education in suitable settings \r\nin line with inclusive education,\r\n• Increasing the share of private sector in education financing,\r\n• Ensuring continuous personal and professional development \r\nof teachers.\r\nLEGISLATION\r\nOur legislation includes regulations in place to ensure the \r\nright to access free and quality education based on equal \r\nopportunities. As per the Basic Law on National Education, \r\neach individual, regardless of gender, has equal right to access \r\nto quality education in educational institutions. Our legislation \r\nprovides facilities including free boarding, scholarship, \r\neducation fee and loan aids to students with financial \r\nlimitations, to receive education up to the highest education \r\nlevels. \r\nOur legislation also has regulations in place to ensure that \r\nindividuals, who have significant diferences in their individual \r\nand developmental characteristics and educational capacities \r\nfrom the expected level from their peers, have equal access \r\nto education with specifically trained personnel, as well as \r\nenhanced education programmes and methods in suitable \r\nsettings. \r\nIMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPROVEMENT AREAS\r\nSDG 4 is assessed on three focus areas: i. Access to quality \r\neducation; ii. Equal opportunities for education; and iii. \r\nVocational education and lifelong learning. \r\nTo ensure quality education, schooling rates were increased, \r\nhuman and physical infrastructure improved and the number \r\nof students per classroom reduced, the curriculum updated, \r\nspecial attention was given for in-service training of teachers, \r\nand funds increased for all levels of education.\r\nThe number of students and net schooling rates were \r\nimproved through the increased duration of compulsory \r\neducation first to 8 years, then to 12 years between 2000-2016. \r\nAdditionally, students were enabled to attend open education \r\nin secondary school.\r\n64\r\nTURKEY’s 2nd VNR 2019\r\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\n“Strong Ground towards Common Goals”\n\nAs a result of the increase in access opportunities, the average \r\neducation duration increased to 7.6 years while expected years \r\nof schooling increased to 17.7 years.\r\nWith the impact of the eforts, practices and projects \r\nundertaken for purposes of the access to education, the \r\nnet schooling rate which was 91% in primary education and \r\n50.6% in secondary education in the academic year of 2002-\r\n2003 was increased to 96.1% and 83.6% respectively in the \r\nacademic year of 2017-2018. The access to higher education \r\nalso increased and the net schooling rate in formal education \r\nfor age 18-22 increased to 45.6% as of the academic year of \r\n2017-2018. \r\nWith 16 public and 4 foundation universities founded in 2018, \r\nthe total number of universities increased to 207 and that of \r\nhigher education students exceeded 8 million. Thus, it became \r\nthe second country with the highest number of students in \r\nhigher education in Europe. \r\nAs a result of the eforts to expand early childhood education, \r\nthere was significant progress in the access to preschool \r\neducation. The net pre-schooling rate which was 11.7% for \r\nages 4 and 5 in the academic year of 2002-2003 increased to \r\n50.4% in the academic year of 2017-2018.\r\nThe transition is in progress from double-shift instruction \r\nto full-day instruction to increase the quality in education. \r\nThe rates of primary school, lower secondary school, and \r\nsecondary school students who were in full-day instruction \r\nin 2013-2014 were 43%, 49%, and 76.5%, respectively and \r\nincreased to 58.7%, 66.4%, and 93.2% respectively in 2017-\r\n2018. \r\nWith new classrooms commissioned recently, there has been \r\nsignificant improvement in terms of the quantity of learning \r\nsettings. The number of students per classroom which was \r\n39 in primary education and 27 in secondary education in \r\nthe academic year of 2002-2003 decreased to 24 and 21 \r\nrespectively in the academic year of 2017-2018.\r\nSteps were taken to increase the access and continuously \r\nimprove the quality in all schools regardless of school type to \r\nreduce the quality diference between schools. The Education \r\nVision 2023 involving a transition from quantity to quality in \r\neducation was published. \r\nThe Higher Education Quality Board was founded in 2018 \r\nas an administratively and financially autonomous body to \r\ninternalise and expand the culture of quality across higher \r\neducational institutions.\r\nFor purposes of improving the education processes, the \r\nnumber of teachers was increased, the Teacher Strategy and \r\nTeacher Competences Framework published, performance \r\nsystem eforts initiated, and education programmes updated \r\nat all levels in line with needs.\r\nAll schools across the country have access to basic utilities \r\nincluding water, hygiene, electricity, internet etc. White Flag \r\nCertificate was institutionalised to encourage sanitation and \r\nhygiene at formal and non-formal educational institutions \r\nas well as to improve overall school health. The White Flag \r\nCertification was awarded to 5,943 schools in 2016, 10,810 \r\nschools in 2017 and 9,340 schools in 2018.\r\nIn 2017, the System of Standards for Preschool and Primary \r\nEducational Institutions was formed to assess service ofered \r\nin pre-schools and primary schools based on minimum \r\nspecified criteria, collect data, and use findings in rehabilitative \r\neforts. School administrators, teachers, parents and children \r\nassess the quality of educational services provided through \r\nthis system.\r\nThe education programmes were renewed to convey values \r\nincluding justice, peace, friendship, respect and love to \r\nstudents under relevant disciplines in 2016 by MoNE.\r\nStrengthening Democratic Culture in Primary Education \r\nproject initiated in 2018 aims to incorporate a democratic \r\nschool culture involving the universal fundamental values \r\nconcerning students, school personnel and families as well as \r\nfundamental rights and freedoms into the education system, \r\nand to strengthen democratic culture practices across society. \r\nIn September 2018, a cooperation protocol was signed \r\nbetween the Ministries of National Education, of Interior, and \r\nof Family, Labour and Social Services to enhance safety in \r\nschools and surroundings.\r\n “Come Out, Let’s Play” project launched in 2010 by MoNE \r\nin cooperation with NGOs. Within the framework of the \r\nproject playgrounds at school premises were constructed \r\nthat allowed children to improve their creativity and \r\ncommunication skills. During the implementation period of \r\nthe project, that took place between 2010-2014, playgrounds \r\nwere established in 500 schools located in 50 provinces. \r\nStarting from 2014, annual education financial support was \r\nallocated to students attending private schools for all levels of \r\n65\r\nTURKEY’s 2nd VNR 2019\r\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\n“Strong Ground towards Common Goals”\n\neducation. During the academic calendar year 2017-2018, 8.3% \r\nof the educational services were provided by private sector. \r\nSuch contribution increased by 13% compared to the previous \r\nperiod.\r\nTurkey implements mobility in education under bilateral \r\nagreements and cooperation with international organisations. \r\nUnder the EU Education and Youth Programmes, more than \r\n27,000 projects and more than 427,000 participants benefited \r\nfrom Erasmus programmes in 2004-2016. Erasmus+ \r\nProgramme being implemented in 2014-2020 period ofers \r\naids for school education, higher education, vocational \r\neducation, adult education, and youth as well as grants for \r\nprojects on sports.\r\nStudents with scholarships are sent abroad for master’s \r\nand doctorate degrees in return for compulsory service with \r\nthe aim of supplying skilled human resource to universities \r\nand public institutions under the International Postgraduate \r\nScholarship Programme.\r\nUnder Mevlana Exchange Programme, students and \r\ninstructors are benefiting from the domestic and foreign \r\nhigher educational institutions exchange programme.\r\nTurkey provides international scholarships to student to gain \r\nfrom and contribute to global knowledge, establish networks \r\nand build mutual relationships. The program received a total \r\nof approximately 10,000 applications in 2012 when it was \r\nlaunched and exceeded 100,000 applications in 2018. About \r\n4000 students annually were awarded with scholarship, while \r\nthe number of applicant countries also almost doubled in the \r\nsame period of time. \r\nRegarding equal opportunities for education; our legislation \r\nguarantees the right to education of all individuals regardless \r\nof gender, language, race, disability or religion and without \r\nprivileging any individual or class. The net schooling rate \r\nin secondary education level which was 39.2% for girls \r\nand 48.5% for boys in the academic year of 2000-2001 \r\nincreased to 83.4% for girls and 83.8% for boys in the 2017-\r\n2018 academic year.

In this framework, practices are developed for vocational education and lifelong learning. \r\nIncreasing the quality of vocational education to raise qualified labour force that is demanded by businesses is one of the main \r\npriorities of Education Vision 2023. \r\nIn the academic year of 2017-2018, 35% of students in secondary education studied in vocational and technical secondary \r\neducational institutions. Of those students, 43.8% were girls and 56.2% were boys. The number of teachers provided educational \r\nsupport was 145,511.\r\nIn the academic year of 2018-2019, educational activities continue with 134,870 teachers and 1,538,019 students in 3,753 \r\nvocational and technical secondary education schools. \r\nSkill-building training and internships for students in real work environment is key for qualified vocational education. State \r\nincentive financially compensate businesses for payment of students’ internships. It is also ensured that vocational and technical \r\nsecondary education students are insured against work accidents and occupational diseases during their internships. \r\nThe project 300 Vocational High Schools for 300 OIZs was launched in 2017 to develop human resources needed in line with \r\nscience, technology and industry policies. The project’s aim is to establish minimum 300 technical high schools in 300 OIZs and \r\neducate qualified sub-professionals through theoretical and practical training programmes applied in those technical high \r\nschools.\r\nLifelong learning programmes and campaigns are implemented to enable individuals to make up their educational shortages, \r\nadapt to scientific, technological, social, and cultural developments, and acquire necessary knowledge and skills for purposes of \r\n25 See Chapter 4.4. \r\n67\r\nTURKEY’s 2nd VNR 2019\r\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\n“Strong Ground towards Common Goals”\n\nin-service and professional development. As of 2017, 34% of \r\nwomen and 14.6% of men of age 15-24 have neither education \r\nnor employment in Turkey. \r\nFor the purposes of lifelong learning, 7 million people \r\nparticipated in approximately 340,000 courses opened, \r\nadvanced technical schools for girls opened and PECs \r\nprovided by MoNE in 2017. Of those courses, 57% is for general \r\npurposes while 43% is for vocational and technical purposes. \r\n59% of participants were women.\r\nConcerning lifelong education, local administrations which \r\nclosely follow the needs of citizens undertake extensive and \r\nefective activities. Easily accessible training programmes are \r\norganised by all segments of the society particularly including \r\nthe disadvantaged. In 2017, approximately 1.8 million people \r\nwith 56.5% women participated in 24,822 courses that was \r\nopened by municipalities.\r\n2019 was declared as the Year of Volunteering and the \r\nVolunteering Strategy was launched to contribute to personal, \r\nvocational and social development of youth to enable them \r\nto become self-confident, entrepreneurial, active and \r\nparticipatory citizens in all aspects of social life.\r\nVocational education programmes are implemented for \r\narrested, convicted ones, people released under probations \r\nand former convicts referred by the protection committees in \r\nthe penal institutions.\r\nMore than 4,000 students in 25 countries received training \r\non vocational knowledge and new technologies with the \r\nsupport of 272 teachers in 20 diferent vocations as part of \r\ninternational collaboration.\r\nIndustries digital transformation should go hand by hand with \r\nthe improved educational program to properly respond and \r\nalign the labor market needs. Additionally, special focus should \r\nbe given to basic sciences including science and technology, \r\nengineering and mathematics while also assessing the \r\npotential competitive sectors, which will ensure the decrease \r\nof unemployment rate. \r\nNEXT STEPS:\r\nThe following policies will be implemented in the upcoming \r\nyears to achieve SDG 4:\r\n• Improving the career guidance system to make vocational \r\ncounselling more efective,\r\n• Cooperating more efectively with the business world to \r\ncreate vocational education programmes in secondary \r\neducation,\r\n• Strengthening the interaction between vocational education \r\nand the labour market, develop collaboration between \r\nschools and businesses,\r\n• Diversifying the early childhood education service with \r\nalternative and flexible programmes with the aim to include \r\ndisadvantaged groups, especially rural and low-population \r\nsettlements,\r\n• Promoting education approaches such as “STEM+A” across \r\nall education levels to strengthen the research sprit, \r\ninnovation, and creativity,\r\n• Adapting higher education and vocational education \r\nprogrammes so as to enhance digital technologies-related \r\nskills and innovation competences of the labour force and \r\nstrengthening entrepreneurial approaches,\r\n• Providing free access up to a certain monthly quota to the \r\nEducational Cyber Network (EBA) to enable all citizens to \r\nbenefit free of charge from digital educational content,\r\n• Providing satellite-based internet connections to 5,100 \r\nschools to enable particularly the vulnerable segments to \r\naccess technology,\r\n• Organising awareness-raising and skill-building training \r\nregarding literacies which are among the 21st century skills \r\nsuch as digital, finance, health, ecology and social media for \r\nall segments of the society and business world. \r\n68\r\nTURKEY’s 2nd VNR 2019\r\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\n“Strong Ground towards Common Goals”",

         "VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 44\r\nPriority Indicators\r\nThe FSM has prioritized eight targets to \r\nensure quality education and promote lifelong \r\nlearning opportunities for all for this goal. \r\nTargets 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.A, 4.B and 4.C are \r\nselected for discussion.\r\nSelected Target Assessment and Progress \r\nThe FSM Association of Chief State \r\nSchool Officers (FACSSO) is the governing body \r\nfor the entire Education Sector in FSM40. This \r\nbody serves an important function in that it \r\nestablishes and implements the curriculum and \r\neducational policy for the nation. \r\nImportantly, the FACSSO endorsed the \r\nFSM Education Sector Strategic Development \r\nPlan (ESSDP) in early 202041. The plan is part of \r\nan overall strategy to prepare the FSM for \r\npotential budgetary challenges “likely to occur \r\nin the immediate future”, with support from \r\nthe Global Partnership for Education (GPE), and \r\naligned with the Pacific Regional Framework \r\n(PacREF), and maintains as an overall goal, to \r\nimprove the quality of learning particularly in \r\nliteracy and numeracy at all education levels in \r\nsafe, climate-resistant learning environments. \r\nThe national gross enrollment rate for \r\nearly childhood education (ECE), primary and \r\nsecondary education has shown a steady \r\nincrease, particularly for early childhood \r\nentrants to school, a good indicator that \r\nfamilies are taking formal education more \r\nTarget 4.1 \r\nEnsure that all girls and boys complete free, \r\nequitable and quality primary and secondary \r\neducation leading to effective learning.\r\nTarget 4.2\r\nEnsure that all boys and girls have access to \r\nquality early childhood development, care and \r\npre-primary education. \r\nTarget 4.3\r\nEnsure equal access for all women and men to \r\naffordable and quality technical, vocational and \r\ntertiary education, including university.\r\nTarget 4.6\r\nEnsure that all youth and substantial portion of \r\nadults achieve literacy and numeracy. \r\nTarget 4.7\r\nEnsure learning promotes sustainable \r\ndevelopment, human rights, gender equality, \r\npeace and non-violence and a cultural of diversity \r\nand sustainability.\r\nTarget 4.A \r\nBuild and upgrade education facilities that are \r\nchild, disability and gender sensitive and provide \r\nsafe, non-violent and inclusive learning \r\nenvironments for all. \r\nTarget 4.B\r\nExpand the number of scholarships in higher \r\neducation for technical, engineering, IT and \r\nscientific programs.\r\nTarget 4.C \r\nIncrease the supply of qualified teachers.\r\nSDG 4: QUALITY EDUCATION\n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 45\r\nseriously42. Enrollment rates are almost equal \r\nfor both boys and girls43. \r\nThis uptake in participation of young \r\nchildren in organized learning at the early \r\nchildhood education (K5) level has more than \r\ndoubled over the last 10 years in the FSM, from \r\n34 percent in 2005, to 76.4 percent in 2015, \r\nand up to 85 percent in 201944. \r\n \r\nThe attendance rate in FSM for children \r\nwho attend the primary and secondary \r\n42ECE is gaining increased attention and funding in the \r\nPacific region and internationally, with considerable \r\nevidence indicating that high-quality early learning \r\nopportunities can lead to better educational outcomes \r\nlater in life (PILNA 2018). \r\n43FSM NDOE Indicators Report 2019, pg 16. \r\n44Per FSM Department of Education and FSM Division of \r\nStatistics data. \r\neducational institutions of the Federation is \r\nsignificant, currently at 94 percent. \r\n \r\n\\ \r\nGlobal evidence from diverse settings \r\nrecommends that rights-centred, life-skills \r\nbased, gender-transformative Comprehensive \r\nSexuality Education (CSE) initiatives have high \r\nefficacy in enabling young people to make \r\ninformed and responsible decisions related to \r\ntheir well-being and health, including Sexual \r\nand Reproductive Health. \r\nIt is noteworthy that the FSM promotes \r\nlife skills education to empower young people \r\nto practice abstinence and delayed onset of \r\nsexual debut and, if sexually active, to \r\nnegotiate safe sex and contraceptive use. \r\nPersonal Responsibility Programme and efforts \r\nto develop Health and Family Life curriculum \r\nare also ongoing, useful initiatives45. \r\nFSM has allocated $205.8M over a \r\ndecade (2016-2025) toward the construction of \r\n45The 2020 Education Summit, held in Pohnpei in \r\nFebruary 2020, reviewed education at the national and \r\nstate level with reference to the education sector \r\nstrategic development goals and recommended \r\nstrategies to sustaining quality education now and \r\nbeyond 2023, and included broad focus on human￾rights, gender, non-violent and sustainability curriculum. \n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 46\r\nnew schools and school facilities throughout \r\nthe islands, the single largest investment in the \r\nnation behind roads and pedestrian facilities46. \r\nThis will be a collaborative effort between the \r\nrespective Departments of Public Works and \r\nthe Departments of Education47. \r\nIn terms of bilateral aid to FSM the \r\neducation sector receives the most assistance, \r\nwith more than 35% of all Overseas \r\nDevelopment Assistance (ODA) going to \r\neducational opportunities, activities and \r\ninfrastructure. \r\nThe number of scholarships and their \r\navailability are also on the rise in FSM. National \r\ngovernment subsidies, grants and contributions \r\noffer financial assistance, a Merit Scholarship \r\nfor the top four valedictorian students in the \r\nnation each year and Sin Tax scholarship for top \r\nqualified students pursuing higher degree at \r\nthe graduate and post-graduate levels (national \r\ngovernment finance statistics 2018). \r\nAs of June 30 2019, a total of 488 \r\nstudents have been awarded national \r\ngovernment sponsored scholarships. \r\nThere are a growing range of \r\nscholarship opportunities available otherwise \r\nas well, including State Scholarships, bi-lateral \r\nscholarships and ongoing training programs \r\nsuch as those offered by the governments of \r\nJapan, Australia, the US, China, as well as \r\nprivately managed and funded scholarships48\n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 47\r\nIn 2009, an estimated 62.5 percent of \r\nTeachers in the FSM had college degrees. By \r\n2019, this had increased to 90% of teachers \r\nnow having degrees in FSM. Kosrae and \r\nPohnpei had the highest proportion of teachers \r\nwith college degrees followed by Chuuk and \r\nYap. \r\nThe vast majority of qualified \r\nteachers have either an Associate of Arts or \r\nAssociate of Science followed by a Bachelor \r\nof Arts 49 . The fourth largest group is \r\nteachers with a High School diploma, all \r\nbelow the formally required minimum for \r\nthe FSM Department of Education. There \r\nare teachers with Masters Degrees, but is a \r\nsmaller minority of the overall total. \r\nTo support enhanced teacher \r\ncertification, the NDOE has entered into a \r\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with \r\nthe College of Micronesia (COM) to offer a \r\nTeacher Certification Program that allows \r\nteachers in public primary and secondary \r\nschools from around the FSM to participate in \r\non-line and in-person courses throughout the \r\nschool year and in the summer when schools \r\nare out. \r\nUNICEFs Water, Sanitation and Hygiene \r\nprogram (WASH) has been adopted and \r\nendorsed by the FSM government, with the \r\nNDOE having built it into the FSM school \r\naccreditation system50. \r\nIn 2018, A WASH in School baseline \r\nsurvey was carried by out covering 24 schools \r\nin Chuuk State as a contribution to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 4.A. The baseline survey \r\nindicated that All 24 schools have pour-flush \r\ntoilets, but these are only functioning in 20 \r\nschools. 11 schools are not meeting the needs \r\nof girls because toilets are shared or the toilet \r\nis not functional. None of the 24 schools have \r\nsanitary materials available for girls to manage \r\ntheir menstruation.\n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 48\r\nFurthermore, a recent US-FSM Joint \r\nEconomic Management Committee (JEMCO)51\r\nResolution places a requirement for FSM \r\nschools to provide potable water, sanitation, \r\nhand washing stations and other such facilities \r\nin support of the WASH being implemented \r\nacross the FSM.\r\nChallenges \r\n While this steady increase in \r\nGross Enrolment Rate (GER) is pleasing, it does \r\nmask issues of age specific enrollment where \r\nthe net enrollment rate suggests considerable \r\nunder and overage enrollment in certain grade \r\nlevels which would be worthy of further \r\ninvestigation and response. \r\nThe Age Specific Enrollment Rate (ASER) \r\nfrom the ages of 5-18 in FSM show that as \r\nstudents enter into secondary education in FSM \r\n– High School – enrollment rates begin to drop \r\nrather precipitously, going from and enrollment \r\nrate of 80 percent at age 13 (first year of high \r\nschool), to an enrollment rate of just 25% of 18 \r\nyear-olds (final year of high school)52. Over the \r\nlast five year period 2015-2019 ASER trends \r\nhave a declining pattern, which the FedEMIS \r\nreport for 2019 indicates “is not a good sign, as \r\nthese populations must remain in the \r\n(education) system (pg. 1.12).” \r\nBeyond this statistic, in 2005, the most \r\nrecent National Minimum Competency Test \r\n(NMCT) revealed that more than half of \r\nchildren and adolescents in the FSM were not \r\nmeeting minimum proficiency standards in \r\nfunctional literacy and numeracy, where only \r\n40 percent could achieve literacy and 47 \r\npercent numeracy for grade 853. This is a key \r\ndata challenge for FSM. \n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 49\r\nThe Education Sector in the FSM is \r\nheavily reliant on US Compact (CoFA) funding \r\nfor a majority of its operational work, with \r\nSector, Federal, Domestic and Supplemental \r\nEducation Grants (SEGs) the primary sources. \r\nThe current negotiations with the US on the \r\nextension of financial provisions of the CoFA \r\nbeyond 2023 will be crucial to ensure that FSM \r\ncontinues to make progress on key targets. \r\nThere is no WASH in Schools policy or \r\nprogram in FSM although some climate change \r\nand disaster risk reduction initiatives cover \r\nwater security at schools. There is no standard \r\nfor separated toilets for boys and girls. Schools \r\nare mandated to have 1 toilet per 25 to 50 \r\nstudents irrespective of gender. There is no \r\npolicy or standard on locks being inside the \r\ntoilet and there are no guidelines for operation \r\nand maintenance of rainwater tanks. \r\nFurthermore functional water and sanitation \r\nfacilities are crucial for infection prevention and \r\ncontrol (IPC) at the school level. \r\nThe school closures due to the COVID￾19 Emergency Declaration in February 2020 \r\nhave exposed the need to develop Educational \r\nContingency Plans (ECPs) in the case of \r\nnecessary closure of schools due to disasters \r\nand emergencies. The FSM NDOE has indicated \r\nthat each SDOE has been working on their \r\nindividual plans to reopen schools54. \r\nToward this end, the NDOE has \r\npartnered with UNICEF on a COVID-19 \r\nResponse Support initiative to develop both a \r\nshort-term contingency plan for at-home \r\nlearning, as well as the framework for a long￾term ECP that the NDOE and SDOEs can utilize \r\nto ensure continuity of learning. \r\nIn this vein, there are gaps in the overall \r\ngovernance and systemic emergency \r\ncoordination between the NDOE and SDOEs, \r\nand any ECP should likely address these gaps. \r\nWay Forward \r\n The analyses show that our students are \r\nstill lacking in the basic education at the \r\nfoundation level. There is a need to place \r\nadditional focus into literacy at the lower \r\ngrades to improve reading and writing \r\ncompetencies. More resources are required. \r\nThis includes more funding as well as additional \r\ntraining and support for teachers, particularly in \r\nthe public schools of the nation. \r\n \r\nThere is a current need to conduct \r\nassessments on internet connectivity and \r\nbandwidth for schools and households as part \r\nof any ECP, both in the short-term and for long￾term policy and planning for continuity of \n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 50\r\nlearning in the event of school closures for \r\nextended periods. \r\nThe FSM ESSD states that the goal of a \r\nvocational training program for the FSM is to \r\nprovide FSM with a competent middle-level \r\nworkforce to meet the demand for vocational \r\nskills from employers or to encourage an \r\nindividual’s self-employment through starting \r\nup their own business. \r\nVocational training programs in FSM have \r\nhad limited success in FSM and the proposed \r\nNational Qualifications Framework (NQF) \r\npublished in March 2019 (but not yet \r\npromulgated for use) could provide an \r\nincentive to curriculum developers, potential \r\nstudents and employers to support new \r\nprograms where a qualification can be obtained \r\nafter 2 to 3 years of study55. \r\nThe governance structure of \r\nfunding/policies/curriculum development for \r\nthe Education Sector will continue to be \r\nenhanced between the NDOE and SDOE in the \r\neffort to achieve the targets of SDG4. This \r\neffort would be supported with rigorous data \r\ncollection and analysis and monitoring using \r\nnational data collection and management \r\nsystems such as FEDEMIS. \r\nNDOE will continue to work the UN \r\nsupport agencies such as UNICEF in supporting \r\nFSM to: \r\n Build upon the existing School Emergency \r\nProtection Plan; \r\n Create some curriculum for ongoing remote \r\nand distance learning during school closures \r\ndue to disasters; \r\n Establish WASH in School policy at national \r\nand state level WASH to ensure children \r\naccess to education facilities that are child, \r\ndisability and gender sensitive and provide \r\nsafe, non-violent and inclusive learning \r\nenvironments for all. \r\nThe SDOEs will continue to be \r\nencouraged to develop their own plans and \r\nhave them ready for funding when school \r\nclosures occur. \r\nThe FSM Education Management \r\nInformation System and FEDSIS for the States \r\nto manage their own data and upload to the \r\nFEDEMIS shall continue to be pursued through \r\nthe US-funded Data Collection Pilot Project. \r\nTo gain full benefit from the NDOE \r\nefforts to ensure formal learning promotes \r\nsustainable development, human rights, gender \r\nequality, peace and non-violence and a cultural \r\nof diversity and sustainability, curriculum \r\nshould be aligned to international guidance, \r\ncontextualized to local realities and scaled up \r\nto reach young people wherever they are in \r\nschools, communities, work places etc. \n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 51\r\nSome relevant SDG4 documents in FSM are: \r\n FEDEMIS NDOE Report, FSM Education \r\nIndicators, August 2019 \r\n FSM Education Fact Sheet 2014 \r\n FSM Infrastructure Development Fund 2016-\r\n2025 \r\n Audit Report 2019-04: Preparedness for \r\nImplementation of SDGs \r\n The Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy \r\nAssessment 2018 (SPC) \r\n FSM Education Sector Strategic \r\nDevelopment Plan (ESSDP) \r\n Pacific Regional Educational Framework \r\n(PacREF) \r\n Education Sector Analysis FSM, 2020 \r\n National Qualifications Framework 2019 \r\n Assessing access to Water, Sanitation, and \r\nHygiene (WASH) in 24 schools in Chuuk \r\nState, FSM 2018 \r\nSource: PILNA\n\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW | 52\r\nYap State Highlight",

         "Barbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n85\r\n SDG 5: Gender Equality\r\n‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’\r\nOverview of SDG 5 \r\nThe GOB is committed to ensuring gender equality at all levels within our society. We believe \r\nthat if women and girls are unable to achieve their full potential due to gender-based and \r\ndomestic violence, it will pose a threat to the overall development of Barbados’ economy and \r\nsociety. Gender equality allows for both sexes to have access to opportunities and are not \r\ndisadvantaged on the basis of whether they are male or female.\r\nThe GOB, through the Bureau of Gender Affairs, continues to work towards gender equality \r\nand to bring about the empowerment of women, through policy, programs and strategies. The \r\nGovernment nevertheless recognizes that the achievement of gender equality cannot be \r\nrealized without the need to create significant and meaningful partnerships. This being the \r\ncase, the Government welcomes and is committed to working with the non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society in this regard.\r\nThe issue of domestic violence and GBV remains a focal area for the Government, especially \r\nduring the heightened COVID-19 period which saw a 38% increase in domestic violence reports \r\nduring the early stages of the 2020, which represented an increase from 2018 numbers.\r\nThe current legal frameworks promote, enforce and monitor gender equality, with a focus on \r\nviolence against women, covering 83.3% of the relevant SDG indicators39. Reports of domestic \r\nviolence between July 2020 and July 2021 are as follows40: \r\n \r\n \r\nEnd all forms \r\nof \r\ndiscrimination\r\nViolence against \r\nwomen & girls\r\nWomen’s \r\nparticipation in \r\ndecision-making\r\nUniversal access \r\nto sexual & \r\nreproductive \r\nhealth\n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n86\r\nBarbados continues to engage in the fight against gender-based violence through several \r\nstrategies and programmes. The Family Conflict Intervention Unit (FCIU) of the Barbados \r\nPolice Service (BPS) works with a high degree of confidentiality with perpetrators, victims, and \r\nthe wider community, to bring awareness to the issue of domestic violence. The FCIU has found \r\nthat since they can issue emergency protection orders and warnings to the perpetrators, \r\nvictims appear to appreciate that the issue is being taken more seriously. Table 8 shows select \r\nstatistics collected by the FCIU, as they relate to victims and perpetrators of domestic violence. \r\nStatistics are supplied for the year 2020, unless otherwise stated. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n87\r\nBased on the data collected from the FCIU, both women and men are victims of domestic \r\nabuse in Barbados. In 2020, it was reported that out of a total of four hundred and thirty-six \r\n(436) cases, in 20.6% of cases men were considered as victims of domestic violence, while \r\nwomen were victims in the remaining 79.4% of cases. Women remain the prime victims of \r\ngender-based violence, while men remain the primary perpetrators of these acts.\r\nThe Bureau of Gender Affairs, cognisant of the need to include men and boys in the fight \r\nagainst gender-based violence, has adopted a Masculinity programme and one aspect of this \r\nprogramme is to work with young males from secondary schools across the island. During the \r\npast years the Bureau has held workshops on the issue of gender-based violence and the link \r\nwith masculinity. These workshops have been held with students from the Lester Vaughn \r\nSecondary School, the Parkinson Memorial Secondary School and most recently in 2021, via \r\nvirtual platform with students at the Princess Margaret Secondary School. \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n88\r\nThe GOB has sought to not only address the victims of gender-based violence / domestic \r\nviolence but has also provided an avenue for the perpetrators of GBV to receive support and \r\ncounselling, through the Partnership for Peace programme, which was launched in 2012 within \r\nthe then Ministry of Social Care. The programme is psycho- educational and the perpetrators \r\nare exposed to several topics, with the goal of teaching them an alternative to violent \r\nbehaviour. Since its inception, approximately one hundred and twenty (120) males have been \r\nthrough the programme, and many have expressed the view that the programme has been \r\nbeneficial. The programme now resides in the Bureau of Gender Affairs and efforts are ongoing \r\nto start the first cohort of applicants within the next few months.\r\nThe National Committee on GBV has been established, which comprises several government \r\nagencies and non-governmental agencies, with a mandate to develop a national action plan to \r\ncombat GBV. An initiative to address GBV in the workplace has also been launched by the \r\nMinistry of Labour, Social Partnership, and the Third Sector (MLSP).\r\nWomen's right to equal participation and freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed \r\nunder the Constitution of Barbados which clearly outlines ‘equity regardless of gender’ \r\nprinciples. There are no legal impediments regarding the participation of women in the \r\nelection process or with respect to women holding office or other leadership positions. In May \r\n2018, the Honourable Mia Amor Mottley S.C; M.P was sworn in as the country’s first female \r\nPrime Minister and for a second time in 2022. In 2021, Her Excellency the Most Honorable \r\nDame Sandra Prunella Mason, FB, GCMG, D.A, Q.C., LLD, become our first female President. \r\nAdditionally, two of our former Governors General (prior to Barbados becoming a Republic) \r\nwere women. Presently, 26.67% of seats in Parliament are held by women. Thirty \r\nparliamentarians (24 males and 6 females) were elected to the lower house by adult suffrage \r\non the first past-the-post system. Since then, a by-election was held in 2020, there are now \r\ntwenty-three males and seven females or 23 %. Twenty-one senators were appointed to the \r\nupper house, 43 % of whom are women. Statistics on women participating in the voting \r\nprocess are provided in the below tables.\r\n \r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n89\r\n \r\nThere was a more than 200 % increase in women candidates from 2013 to 2018. It should be \r\nnoted that, apart from the traditional two political parties contesting the elections, an \r\nadditional seven parties fielded women candidates in 2018.\r\n \r\nNumber and Proportion of Judges and Prosecutors who are Women\r\nAt 2021, there were seven female High Court judges and seven males. Within the Court of \r\nAppeal, there were two females and three males. (See Table 12 below).\r\n \r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n90\r\n \r\nWomen Appointed to Sit on Boards of Management \r\nThe disparity between men and women sitting on the boards of management of various public \r\nand private entities continued to be an issue of concern. An Evaluation of Board Diversity in \r\nBarbados was conducted in 2020 on behalf of the Barbados Branch of the International \r\nWomen’s Forum. The results of the online survey, which included the private sector (72 %), \r\nnon-governmental organisations (6 %) and public service/statutory organisations revealed that \r\nonly approximately 29 % of the board members were female.\r\nThe GOB recognises that additional work is required to advance SDG 5, particularly with respect \r\nto adolescent births and unpaid care work. The adolescent birth rate stood at 49.7 per 1,000 \r\nwomen aged 15-19 in 2007, up from 45.8 per 1,000 in 2006. Other areas requiring focus for \r\nadditional data gathering include unpaid work and domestic care. Barbados obtained an \r\noverall score of 0.83 in the Gender Gap Index in the area of economic participation and \r\nopportunity in Barbados in 2022 (by category). This indicated economic disparities between \r\nwomen and men in Barbados. Closing these gender gaps is essential for achieving gender￾related SDG commitments in Barbados. Below is a snapshot of Barbados’ progress towards \r\nachieving SDG 5. \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n91\r\nSDG 5.1.1 focuses on the legal frameworks in a country that promote, enforce, and monitor \r\ngeneral equality. Barbados’ status in four key areas is highlighted in Figure 14. \r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n92\r\nProjects & Initiatives \r\nThe National Committee for Gender-Based Violence \r\nIn 2019, the GOB approved the establishment of a National Committee for Gender-based \r\nViolence charged with the overall responsibility to develop strategies, initiatives and \r\nprogrammes aimed at reducing gender-based violence in all its forms.\r\nPartnership for Peace \r\nEfforts to address SDG 5 also target the men in our society. Through the Partnership for Peace, \r\nour men are encouraged and supported in achieving a violence-free lifestyle. The Partnership \r\nfor Peace, an initiative of UN Women, is a psycho-educational programme designed to \r\nencourage offenders to take responsibility for their violent actions and equip them with skills \r\nto end that behaviour. \r\nIt is deemed \"as a new beginning and not a punitive measure for the men, as they will be \r\nafforded an opportunity to turn their lives around and embark on a life-changing journey that \r\ncould reap significant long-term benefits\". Following several successful outcomes of the \r\ninitiative, a recommendation was made for women to be included as the target audience for \r\nthe programme.\r\nThe Caribbean Policy for Gender-Based \r\nViolence in the Workplace \r\nThe policy gives clear, practical \r\nguidelines on creating a safe \r\nenvironment for the confidential and \r\nappropriate handling of reports of GBV \r\nincidents, in addition to providing a \r\nframework for addressing challenges \r\nfaced by survivors of GBV in the \r\nworkplace. This joint initiative between the Caribbean Employers’ Confederation (CEC) and the\r\nCaribbean Confederation of Labour (CCL), is supported by the United Nations Population Fund \r\nThe Barbados Advocate, 2019\n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n93\r\n(UNFPA) and ILO under the Spotlight Initiative, with generous funding from the EU to eliminate \r\nall forms of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in the world of work.\r\n \r\nThe gender-based violence in the workplace project \r\nThis project followed a Memorandum of Understanding between UN Women and the Ministry \r\nof Labour, Social Partnership and the Third Sector in an effort to heighten awareness of this \r\ntype of violence in the workplace.\r\nThe Spotlight Initiative \r\nThe Regional Spotlight Initiative entitled: “Strengthening Regional Cooperation to Prevent and \r\nRespond to Family Violence in the Caribbean” is being jointly implemented by four UN agencies \r\n(UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, and UNFPA). The Spotlight Initiative has a 6-tiered approach: (1) \r\nreforming legal procedures, (2) improving the capacity of national institutions for evidence￾based violence prevention programmes, (3) expanding programmes that prevent family \r\nviolence, (4) supporting improved service delivery to survivors of family violence, (5) enhancing \r\ndata collection, analysis, monitoring on violence against women and girls, and (6) improving \r\nthe capacity of national civil society organisations to design, implement and monitor violence \r\nprevention programmes.\r\nOnline Initiative to Enhance Career Opportunities with an Emphasis on Women Participation \r\nWith the partnership between the government and Coursera, Barbadians can gain significant \r\nbenefits that can also enhance their digital competencies and expand their range of career \r\nopportunities. The partnership between Coursera, one of the world’s leading online learning \r\nplatforms, and Government’s NTI, is designed to equip Barbadians with the knowledge, skills \r\nand values to be citizens of good character and competence in a digital world. \r\nThe success and impact of this initiative has paved the way for a long-term partnership, \r\nmarking NTI and Coursera’s joint commitment to helping Barbadians prepare for a digital \r\nfuture. As part of the initiative, Coursera and Google, a Coursera industry partner, are providing \r\n20,000 scholarships to Barbadian women across the country.\r\n \r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n94\r\nGender Based Violence (GBV) Referral Pathways \r\nBarbados is one of seven Caribbean countries and territories that has launched GBV Referral \r\npathways with the support of UNFPA Barbados. GBV Referral pathways facilitate primary duty \r\nbearers and actors with information on how to respond to GBV cases and provides guidance \r\nfor survivors of GBV on where to seek assistance and what services are available at different \r\nreferral points. GBV Pathways can include any of the following: Case Management, Health, \r\nPsychosocial, Security and Protection, Legal/Justice, and/or Economic support.\r\n \r\nThe Bureau of Gender Affairs \r\nThe Bureau of Gender Affairs, under the MPEA, is continuing its efforts to promote gender \r\nequality and eliminate gender-based violence. Through an Act of Parliament, a National \r\nCommittee on Gender Based Violence was established in 2015. The Committee was \r\nestablished with a view to providing a more holistic and collaborative approach to the efforts \r\nat tackling gender-based violence. The Committee has a mandate to develop a National Action \r\nPlan against gender-based violence.\r\nThe Bureau of Gender Affairs has also targeted young males from the secondary schools in \r\nefforts to address gender-related issues in Barbados. The annual workshops for young male \r\nstudents were designed to introduce young males to the concepts of gender, masculinity, and \r\ngender-based violence. These workshops were further intended to provide these students with \r\nan understanding of how gender and masculinity impact behaviour and can lead to acts of \r\ngender-based violence. \r\nThe Bureau of Gender Affairs also recognised the need for gender discourses within the MPEA. \r\nTherefore, the Bureau in collaboration with the UNDP, organised training sessions with MPEA \r\nHeads of Sections, to sensitise key decision-makers on the concepts of gender and gender \r\ninequality, particularly in relation to programme design and delivery. Such training sessions will \r\ncontinue to impact the ability of men and women to avail themselves of the basic human right \r\nto engage equally in all areas of their lives and endeavours.\n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n95\r\nCivil Society and NGO initiatives\r\nThe Barbados Association of Muslim Ladies \r\nThe Barbados Association of Muslim Ladies, an associate organisation of the Barbados Muslim \r\nAssociation, has undertaken several programs for women and girls. These programs have \r\nfacilitated seminars and workshops targeted at empowerment. The Association has also \r\nworked with other agencies in Barbados, including Institute for Gender Studies, to build out \r\nbetter opportunities for young girls and women within the Muslim community and the wider \r\nsociety.\r\nSAVE Foundation \r\nThe SAVE Foundation raises awareness of domestic violence through community outreach \r\nprogrammes and sensitizes Barbadians to their rights under the Domestic Violence Protection \r\nOrders Act and provides training for stakeholders and collaborates with agencies to address \r\ndomestic violence, record and monitor incidents of domestic violence in Barbados and \r\nadvocates for the adoption of conventions on domestic violence.\r\nProjects include the sensitization of domestic violence survivors to their rights. The Foundation \r\nalso offers free mental health counseling for victims of domestic violence (including children) \r\nand free legal advice. 6-week workshops targeted at livelihood skills and financial management \r\nare also offered to survivors. Since 2009, an estimated forty-nine thousand (49, 000) persons \r\nwere impacted by the work of the SAVE Foundation. \r\nBarbados International Business Association – BIBA \r\nBIBA, the Association of Global Business service companies in Barbados is focused on \r\noperationalizing and actualizing the SDGs within the private sector. The organization is involved \r\nin several projects and initiatives related to sustainable development and corporate \r\nresponsibility. One recent initiative undertaken by the organization, in collaboration with Open \r\nfor Business, is focused on SDG 5 (Gender Equality). A workshop was conducted with the \r\nfinancial sector to address the needs of Lesbian Gays Bisexual Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ)\r\nclients and develop internal policies that respect client identities.\r\n \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n96\r\nThe Barbados Workers Union \r\nThe BWU addresses SDG 5 (Gender Equality) through its Gender Committee, which is actively \r\ninvolved in reducing inequality in Barbados and the wider Caribbean. This Committee works on \r\npromoting female empowerment, and gender equality, and also works to address pay and \r\ncompensation imbalances. The committee organizes panel discussions and collaborates with \r\norganizations including the UWI, to educate members on topics related to gender equality. The \r\nCommittee also focuses on addressing ingrained cultural norms related to sexual harassment \r\nthrough a series of education and awareness-raising initiatives.\r\nThe BWU engages in policy discussions, particularly in relation to issues faced by the LGBTQ \r\ncommunity, in an effort to support workers that have faced discrimination based on their \r\nsexual preferences or gender identity. The BWU focuses on educating the public and finding \r\nsolutions to challenges within the workplace and respecting individual rights. The union also \r\nemphasizes decent work and economic growth, advocating for equality and equity to benefit \r\nworkers. \r\nBusiness and Professional Women’s Club \r\nBPW’s overriding mandate of equal rights, social justice and empowerment of women are the \r\nmainstay of all its projects. The BPW executes several projects aimed at implementation of\r\nSDG 5. The BPW has conducted a self-development programme for over three hundred (300)\r\nwomen over the past 5 years. Their projects/programmes include a crisis centre and hotline \r\nwhich handles, rape, sexual assault, Intimate Partner Violence and Domestic Violence and \r\nSuicide which begun in 1986 and runs daily. The hotline provides counselling and is a gateway \r\nto the BPW Shelter. The crisis centre is also an information and educational arm to all the \r\nsectors dealing with these areas including the judicial, police, social workers, medical fraternity \r\netc. The crisis centre has handled over twenty-thousand 20,000 calls since it started. BPW \r\noperates the shelter for abused women and their children which was started in 1999. The \r\nshelter has housed over twenty-three hundred (2,300) women since it started operation. \r\n \r\nThe BPW visits schools and tertiary education institutions to discuss with students various \r\naspects of becoming a young lady/gentleman and providing information and awareness of \r\nTeen Education & Dating Violence, gender base violence, anger management, conflict \n\nBarbados Voluntary National Review 2023\r\n97\r\nresolution and introducing human rights to the youth. They have visited over fifteen (15)\r\nprimary and secondary schools and two (2) tertiary institutions in the past five (5) years. \r\nI am a Girl Barbados \r\nThe “I am a Girl” is a Leading Non-Profit Community in Support of Girls. This non-profit \r\norganization dedicated to empowering young girls and giving them opportunities to lead and \r\ncreate positive change. The organization provides capacity building, mentorship, and guidance \r\nto girls aged five (5) to eighteen (18), with the goal of making a long-term difference in their \r\nlives and promoting positive and long-term change in their community.

         "30\r\nGoal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\r\nPolicy Environment\r\nZimbabwe is committed to the achievement of gender equality and women empowerment. \r\nIn line with this commitment, the country has ratified a number of gender related \r\ninternational and regional instruments. These include the Convention on the Elimination of \r\nall forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), \r\nthe African Charter on the Rights of Women and the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity Protocol on Gender and Development.\r\nThe Constitution provides a robust legal framework for the promotion of SGD 5. In \r\nparticular, Section 3(g) of the Constitution clearly spells out gender equality as one of the \r\nfounding and guiding values placed on a par with values such as the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance. Section 56 (2) of the new Constitution clearly states that ‘Women and men \r\nhave the right to equal treatment including to the right to equal opportunities in political, \r\neconomic, cultural and social spheres.’ Section 56 (3) states that ‘Every person has the right \r\nnot to be treated in an unfairly discriminatory manner on such grounds as custom , culture \r\nsex gender, marital status, age, pregnancy, disability among other grounds.’ Section 17 calls \r\nupon Government to ensure full gender balance and to take measures to promote the full \r\nparticipation of women in all spheres on the basis of equality with men. This includes equal \r\nrepresentation in all institutions, agencies of government, commissions and other elective \r\nbodies at all levels. Women’s access to resources, including land on the basis of equality \r\nwith men is also guaranteed. Furthermore, Section 124(1) (b) provides for seats reserved for \r\nwomen. The reservation of seats is aimed at promoting female participation in the political \r\nsphere. Government has put in place several policies and strategies to actualise these \r\nprovisions and include:\r\n The National Gender Policy (NGP) (2017) which seeks to achieve a gender just \r\nsociety where men and women enjoy equality and participate as equal partners in \r\nthe development process of the country. The policy goal is ‘to eradicate gender \r\ndiscrimination and inequalities in all spheres of life and development.’ The thematic \r\nareas of the Revised National Gender Policy have been aligned to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs).\r\n The Zimbabwe Gender Commission (ZGC) whose functions include among others: to \r\nmonitor issues concerning gender equality to ensure gender equality as provided for \r\nin the Constitution; to investigate possible violations of rights relating to gender; to \r\nconduct research into issues relating to gender and social justice, and to recommend \r\nchanges to laws and practices which lead to discrimination based on gender.\r\n The outlawing of marriage of persons below the age of 18 by the Constitutional \r\nCourt in 2016. This is a landmark ruling that will advance child rights in Zimbabwe by \r\nhelping to end the harmful and prevalent practice of marrying children. The ruling \r\nnot only upholds the Constitution but also reaffirms Zimbabwe’s commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the African \r\nCharter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.\r\n In 2016, Zimbabwe developed a National Action Plan to end Child marriage. The \r\nNational Action Plan on Ending Child Marriage will guide Zimbabwe in undertaking \n\n31\r\nprogrammes to address the root causes of child marriages as it provides for \r\nEconomic Empowerment of Girls and young women and strengthening child \r\nprotection mechanisms.\r\n In 2016, Zimbabwe developed a National Gender Based Violence Strategy and a \r\nNational Programme on GBV Prevention and Response (2016-2020).\r\n In 2016 the Government of Zimbabwe established 2 One Stop Centres (OSCs) for \r\nsurvivors of Gender Based Violence in two provinces of the country which are \r\nMatabeleland South and Midlands. The OSCs are designed to reduce the number of \r\ninstitutions that a survivor must visit to receive basic support following an incident of \r\nGBV. The One Stop Model of service provision brings together different service \r\nproviders namely health, psycho-social and victim friendly services under one roof. \r\nIn 2016, the one stop centres offered services to a total of 17 000 GBV survivors. \r\n Appointment of an Anti-Domestic Violence Council by Government in April 2017 in \r\nline with the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act. This council comprises \r\ntraditional leaders, government officials and members of civil society. Some of the \r\nfunctions of the Council include: to keep under constant review the problem of \r\ndomestic violence in Zimbabwe; to take all the steps to disseminate information and \r\nincrease the awareness of the public on issues of domestic violence; and to promote \r\nresearch into the problem of domestic violence.\r\n The 2016-2020 ZUNDAF also provides an entry point for the Government of \r\nZimbabwe, the UN, development partners and stakeholders to address gender \r\ninequalities in line with the Constitution and ZIMASSET through specific \r\nprogramming on key issues such as violence against women, women’s participation \r\nin politics and decision making, and women’s economic empowerment, while at the \r\nsame time mainstreaming gender in all other priority areas. Through integrating the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5 to achieve gender equality and \r\nempower all women and girls, ZUNDAF interventions will focus on: strengthening the \r\ncapacity of institutions to promote gender equality; strengthening the legal and \r\npolicy frameworks; empowering women and girls to exercise their rights; and \r\ncreating an enabling and supportive community environment.\r\n In 2016, Zimbabwe developed the National Monitoring and Evaluation Framework \r\nfor Gender Equality and Women Empowerment to improve accountability and \r\nimplementation of gender equality and women empowerment commitments in \r\nZimbabwe. The GEWE M&E Framework promotes an inclusive, multi-sectoral, and \r\nmulti-stakeholder approach which facilitates strong involvement of not only state \r\ninstitutions, but also independent bodies set up by the government and non-state \r\nactors (including CSOs, the private sector, research institutions, and development \r\npartners) in reinforcing measurement of, and accountability for GEWE-related \r\ndevelopment results.\r\nStatus and Trends\r\nThe following key developments/milestones have been achieved:\r\n Representation of women in decision-making bodies has increased. The \r\nrepresentation of women in the senate increased from 23.2 per cent in 2012 to 47.5 \r\nper cent in 2017 (Figure 10 and Table 9) and from 16 per cent in 2012 to 32.6 per \n\n32\r\ncent in 2017 in the National Assembly (Figure 11). Zimbabwe fares better than both \r\nthe SSA and World averages as shown in Figure 12. There is room for improvement in \r\nterms of the women representation in the cabinet. There is also need to increase the \r\nparticipation of women in key leadership positions in parastatals/state enterprises.\r\n Increase in female judges in the Supreme and Labour Courts: Table 10 shows the \r\ndistribution of personnel working in the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) for the \r\nyears 2013, 2014 and 2015. Across the years, there were more female judges than \r\nmen in the Supreme Court and in the Labour Court. Among the Magistrates in the\r\nChief Magistrate’s Department, women were underrepresented across the years.\r\n The 2014 female HDI value for Zimbabwe is 0.487, in contrast with 0.529 for males, \r\nresulting in a Gender Development Index (GDI) value of 0.922 (Table 11). In \r\ncomparison, GDI values for Lesotho and Kenya are 0.953 and 0.913 respectively. \r\nZimbabwe has a Gender Inequality Index value of 0.504, ranking it 112 out of 155 \r\ncountries in 2014. \r\n Increase in the Labour Force Participation by women. In the labour market, \r\napproximately 41 per cent of women and 65 per cent of men aged 15-49 are \r\nemployed. Among women, 37 per cent were employed in 2010-11, compared with \r\n41 per cent in 2015. Among men, the percentage has increased from 61 per cent to \r\n65 per cent. Women remain trapped in low productivity economic activities.\r\n Generally women spend more time in unpaid activities than men. Women spent an \r\naverage 17 hours per week in unpaid caring for children under five years in own \r\nhousehold compared to 7 hours among men. Women spent an average of 14hours \r\nper week caring for the sick, disabled and elderly while men spent about 11 hours. In \r\nterms of housekeeping and other home duties, women spent about 18 hours and \r\nmen an average of 8 hours.\r\n Reduction in proportion of women experiencing physical violence: Government \r\nplaces high priority to efforts to prevent and combat violence and sexual abuse \r\nagainst women. These efforts are bearing fruit as shown in Figure 13.\r\n Women have lower status in access, control and ownership of economic assets and \r\npositions in decision-making. According to the 2015 ZDHS about 37 per cent of \r\nwomen and men own a house. Among women, 30 per cent own land, and among \r\nmen 34 per cent own land.\r\n Data from the Central Business Register Inquiry 2015 shows that women generally \r\nhave a smaller share of business establishments compared to men. Out of 31,000\r\nsole proprietor establishments, 22 per cent are owned by women. Women had \r\nmajority share ownership in about 17 per cent of establishments that operated as \r\ncooperatives.\r\n More females than males are progressing to secondary school: Female – 79.1 per \r\ncent; Male – 76.7 per cent (2015 World Bank Gender Data Portal).\r\n Lower secondary completion rate for female is higher than male: Female – 66.6 per \r\ncent; Male – 64.5 per cent (2015 World Bank Gender Data Portal).\r\n Prevalence of Gender Based Violence (GBV) still high: percentage of ever-married \r\nwomen age 15-49 who have experienced various form of violence ever or in the 12 \r\nmonths preceding the survey, committed by their husbands/partners (ZDHS 2015). \r\nPhysical violence: ever (30.7 per cent); often (3.3 per cent); sometimes (11.9 per \r\ncent); often or sometimes (15.2 per cent). Sexual violence: ever (12.7 per cent); \r\noften (2.4 per cent); often or sometimes (9.3 per cent). Emotional violence: ever \n\n33\r\n(31.5 per cent); often (7.2 per cent); often or sometimes (23.5 per cent). Frequency \r\nof physical or sexual violence: Percentage of ever-married women who have \r\nexperienced physical or sexual violence by any husband/partner in the past 12 \r\nmonths, according to background characteristics: 15-19 (31.5 per cent); 20-24 (25.3 \r\nper cent); 25-29 (24.7 per cent); 20-39 (18.2 per cent); 40-49 (10.7 per cent).\r\n Incidence of child marriage: percentage of women age 15-49 married before age 15 \r\n(4.5 per cent); percentage of women age 20-49 married before 15 (5.4 per \r\ncent)/before 18 (32.8 per cent) (MICS 2014).\r\nTable 9: Participation of Women and Men in Selected Decision Making Positions\r\nInstitution/Area Women Men Total Share of Women (%)\r\nNational Assembly (Lower House) 86 184 270 31.9\r\nSenate (Upper House) 38 42 80 47.5\r\nCabinet Ministers 4 22 26 15.4\r\nProvincial Ministers 4 6 10 40\r\nBoard of Parastatals/State \r\nEnterprises 29 71 100 29\r\nChief Executive Officers of \r\nParastatals/State Enterprises 23 77 100 23\r\nVice Chancellors of State \r\nUniversities 3 8 11 27.3\r\nAmbassadors 10 31 41 24.4\r\nConsulars 0 5 5 0\r\nSource: Understanding Gender Equality in Zimbabwe: Women and Men Report 2016.\r\nTable 10: Distribution of Positions in the Judiciary by Sex, 2013-2016\r\n 2013 2014 2015\r\nPosition Female Male Female Male Female Male\r\nSupreme Court Chief Justice 0 1 0 1 0 1\r\nDeputy Chief \r\nJustice 0 1 0 1 0 1\r\nJudges 5 3 5 3 6 5\r\nHigh Court\r\nJudge \r\nPresident 0 1 0 1 0 1\r\nJudges 11 18 11 18 13 18\r\nLabour Court Senior Judge 1 0 1 0 1 0\r\nJudges 10 5 10 4 10 4\r\nChief Magistrate's \r\nDept.

As noted in the 2014 Zimbabwe \r\nCountry Analysis Report by the UN, the exercise of women’s rights is negatively impacted \r\nby:\r\n Weak programming not backed by gender statistics: Programming still needs to be \r\nstrengthened through the use of available gender statistics and a gender analysis \r\nto make gender mainstreaming more visible.\r\n Identified gender issues which are not fully resourced.\r\n Laws and policies have been enacted for an enabling legal environment against \r\ngender based violence, however there is need for strengthened support for the \r\nenforcement of laws and policies.\r\n Socio-cultural practices and attitudes continue to perpetuate the high prevalence \r\nof violence against women and girls, which negatively affects their abilities to \r\nexercise many of their socio-economic rights.\r\n The majority of women are economically inactive and are concentrated in \r\nvulnerable employment in the informal sector. Women, who are in the formal \r\neconomy, remain largely excluded from financial services and products that cater \r\nfor both their business and household needs, even though they are 57 per cent of \r\nthe business owners (FinScope Survey 2012).\r\n31.5\r\n47.5\r\n22.2 23.8 23.4 22.8\r\n0\r\n5\r\n10\r\n15\r\n20\r\n25\r\n30\r\n35\r\n40\r\n45\r\n50\r\nLower House Upper House Lower House Upper House Lower House Upper House\r\nZimbabwe SSA World\r\nFigure 12: Crosscountry comparison of women representation (%) as at 1 \r\nMarch 2017",

         "13 | Page\r\nGoal 6 – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\r\nIn Norway, there is universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate and \r\nequitable sanitation and sewerage for all. It is expected that further efforts will be necessary to \r\ndeal with the increasing impacts of climate change, such as changes in temperature, higher \r\nprecipitation, more frequent extreme weather events and the spread of new pathogens. \r\nNorway has strict regulations concerning emissions of hazardous substances and water \r\npollution, particularly for sources of drinking water. Dumping of waste has been practically \r\neliminated in Norway, and the national waste management systems and legislation protect \n\n14 | Page\r\nwater from contamination. Most wastewater and sewage is treated, and since 2008 the \r\nremaining untreated wastewater and sewage has been reduced by around 20 %. In Norway, \r\nthere is in general sufficient water for all and therefore little need for increasing water-use \r\nefficiency on grounds of scarcity. River basin management plans under the Water Framework \r\nDirective aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status for most water bodies by 2033 \r\nor earlier. Water-related ecosystems will also be further protected and restored in accordance \r\nwith the Norwegian Action Plan for Biodiversity, which was adopted in 2016. \r\nAt the international level, Norway supports water and sanitation activities in a number of \r\ncountries through key sectors, e.g. health, education, rural development, humanitarian \r\nassistance, rather than as independent activities and programmes. Women’s and children’s \r\nissues are of particular concern. A lack of safe, separate and private sanitation and washing \r\nfacilities in schools is one of the main reasons for high dropout rates among girls, putting \r\nthem at a disadvantage compared to boys and limiting their opportunities later in life. This \r\nunderscores the importance of including relevant water and sanitation components in \r\neducation and health programmes. Likewise, access to water and sanitation is key in \r\nhumanitarian interventions. A Norwegian NGO (Norwegian Church Aid) provides water and \r\nsanitation to about 1 million people per year, mostly in refugee camps. Furthermore, UNICEF \r\nhas been able to provide 10 500 schools with water and sanitation facilities. Norway seeks to \r\nfoster cooperation on transboundary water resources and on improving water resources \r\nmanagement, primarily with a view to developing hydropower resources. Furthermore, \r\nNorway assists in conflict resolution and establishing cooperation on the joint management of \r\ntransboundary water resources, especially in the Nile and the Himalaya regions, and supports \r\nactivities for better wastewater treatment and management in developing countries through \r\nUNEP.",

CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION\r\n112\r\nBy 2030, achieve universal and equitable \r\naccess to safe and affordable drinking \r\nwater for all.\r\nTARGET 6.1\r\nBy 2030, achieve access to adequate and \r\nequitable sanitation and hygiene for all \r\nand end open defecation, paying special \r\nattention to the needs of women and girls \r\nand those in vulnerable situations\r\nTARGET 6.2\r\nBy 2030, improve water quality in water \r\nbodies, by reducing pollution, eliminating \r\ndumping and minimizing release of \r\nhazardous chemicals and materials, \r\nhalving the proportion of untreated \r\nwastewater and substantially increasing \r\nrecycling and safe reuse locally.\r\nTARGET 6.3\r\nB R A Z I L I A N SD G \r\nTARGETS\r\nBy 2030, substantially increase water-use \r\nefficiency across all sectors and ensure \r\nsustainable withdrawals and supply of \r\nfreshwater to substantially reduce the \r\nnumber of people suffering from water \r\nscarcity.\r\nTARGET 6.4\n\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2023 113\r\nBy 2030, expand international cooperation \r\nand capacity-building support to \r\ndeveloping countries in water- and \r\nsanitation-related activities and programs, \r\nincluding water resource management, \r\nwater harvesting, desalination, water use \r\nefficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling \r\nand reuse technologies.\r\nTARGET 6.A\r\nSupport and strengthen the participation \r\nof local communities, prioritizing social \r\ncontrol in improving water and sanitation \r\nmanagement.\r\nTARGET 6.B\r\nBy 2030, implement integrated water \r\nresources management at all levels \r\nof government, including through \r\ntransboundary cooperation.\r\nTARGET 6.5\r\nBy 2020, protect and restore water￾related ecosystems, including mountains, \r\nforests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes, \r\nreducing the impacts of human action.\r\nTARGET 6.6\n\nSDG 6. CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION\r\n116\r\nThe State Government has carried \r\nout actions that meet the purposes \r\nembodied in the targets of SDG \r\n6, in the sense of promoting and \r\nproviding users with access to public \r\nbasic sanitation services.\r\nThe activities are aligned with target \r\n6.1 – By 2030, achieve universal \r\nand equitable access to safe and \r\naffordable drinking water for all – \r\nand target 6.2 – By 2030, achieve \r\naccess to adequate and equitable \r\nsanitation and hygiene for all and \r\nend open defecation, paying special \r\nattention to the needs of women \r\nand girls and those in vulnerable \r\nsituations. \r\nIn this sense and related to target \r\n6.1, in 2022, the expansion of new \r\nwater supply connections stands \r\nout, benefiting 4,700 households in \r\nthe municipalities of Monte Alegre, \r\nSantarém, Castanhal, Santo Antônio \r\ndo Tauá and São Sebastião de \r\nBoa Vista, Trairão and Rurópolis, \r\nguaranteeing access to drinking \r\nwater and sanitary sewage, \r\nbenefiting around 23,270 people, \r\nwith investments of R$ 200 million. \r\n In this list of water supply works, \r\nit is also worth mentioning the \r\ninvestments in works to implement \r\nthe municipal supply system, \r\nproviding treated and quality water in \r\nthe homes of more than 14 thousand \r\nresidents in the municipality of Afuá, \r\nin the Marajó Archipelago. Another \r\nhighlight was the Completion of \r\nthe Water Supply System (SAA), \r\nin the municipality of Faro (Baixo \r\nAmazonas). And the completion of \r\nthree water distribution sectors in \r\nCastanhal (Jaderlândia, Estrela and \r\nCOHAB). They are state initiatives in \r\nthe search for universal access and \r\nimprovement of the quality of life of \r\nthe population.\r\nWHAT WE DID\n\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2023 117\r\n• Water Tanks for All project\r\nWithin target 6.1, the Water Tanks \r\nfor All project enabled the installation \r\nof 10,421 water tanks in 27 districts \r\nof the municipality of Belém, \r\nguaranteeing quality water for the \r\npopulation, totaling an investment \r\nof R$ 28 million.\r\nWATER SUPPLY \r\nIN CASTANHAL\r\nWATER TANKS \r\nFOR ALL \r\nPROJECT \n\nSDG 6. CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION\r\n118\r\n• Pará Water Program \r\nContributing to target 6.1, the \r\nPará Water Program, by 2022, had \r\nregistered around 250 thousand \r\nfamilies, with an average monthly \r\nconsumption of up to 20 m3 (20 \r\nthousand liters of water), with excess \r\nconsumption guaranteed by the \r\nprogram, in an investment of around \r\nR$ 170 million in total. \r\n• Macro Drainage of the \r\nTucunduba Channel \r\nThe Macro Drainage of the \r\nTucunduba Channel works, in Belém, \r\nmeet targets 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, by \r\nguaranteeing integrated sanitation \r\nprojects with public investment of \r\nR$ 257.6 million in three stages, \r\nin the 2019-2022 period. In 2022, \r\nmore than 300 thousand people \r\nwere benefited in the capital, in the \r\ndistricts of Guamá, Terra Firme, \r\nCanudos and Marco, in Belém, and \r\nthe projects included the rectification \r\nof streams, the water supply \r\nsystem, the road system, services of \r\nrainwater drainage, sanitary sewage \r\nand backyard grounding, in addition \r\nto the payment of 81 pecuniary \r\nindemnities.\r\nPARÁ WATER \r\nPROGRAM\r\nWATER PARÁ \r\nPROGRAM: MACRO \r\nDRAINAGE OF \r\nTHE TUCUNDUBA \r\nCHANNEL\n\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2023 119\r\n• Sewerage \r\nAligned with target 6.2, resources \r\nof R$ 27.82 million guaranteed the \r\nconstruction work to implement the \r\nsanitary sewage system in Alter do \r\nChão, in the municipality of Santarém, \r\nand in the UMA sector, in Belém. \r\n In the area of Environment and \r\nTerritorial Planning, efforts to \r\nimprove water quality in water bodies \r\nand ensure the supply of fresh water \r\nare aligned with targets 6.3 and 6.4. \r\nIn this respect, in 2022, the State of \r\nPará Water Resources Conjuncture \r\nReport was completed, the first in the \r\nNorthern Region and the fifth in Brazil, \r\non the situation of water in the State, \r\nin addition to data on hydrological \r\nmonitoring and the challenges for \r\nthe coming years. The network \r\nfor monitoring water quality and \r\nmeasuring the flow of water bodies—\r\nessential for building references and \r\ncharacterizing rivers and other water \r\nbodies, in addition to being a source \r\nof consultation for the execution \r\nof the State Water Resources Plan \r\n(PERH)—promoted a total of 294 \r\nanalyzes, in 66 municipalities of the \r\nfollowing Hydrographic Units: Acará, \r\nAraguaia, Baixo Xingu, Capim, Costa \r\nAtlântica, Fresco, Guamá, Gurupi, \r\nltacaiúnas, Mojú and Tocantins. \r\nSEWERAGE\n\nSDG 6. CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION\r\n120\r\nStill in the environmental area and \r\naddressing targets 6.5 and 6.6, \r\nwith regard to implement integrated \r\nwater resources management and \r\nprotect and restore water-related \r\necosystems, it is worth mentioning \r\nthe State Water Resources Plan \r\n(PERH), implemented in 2021, which \r\nestablishes state public policies \r\nfor managing the sector. In 2002, \r\nthe PERH Update Work Plan was \r\npublished; Sectorial Workshops were \r\nheld with the River Basin Committees \r\nto understand and discuss the issues. \r\nThe result of the Workshops allowed \r\nthe creation of the PERH Strategic \r\nMap, which included popular \r\nparticipation. \r\nThrough the Amazon Water Quality \r\nLaboratory (LQAA), of the State \r\nUniversity Pará, it contributes to the \r\nexecution of projects and research, \r\nin addition to generating data and \r\ninformation relevant to scientific \r\nresearch on the analysis of local \r\nwater resources, in alignment with \n\nVOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE STATE OF PARÁ 2023 121\r\ntargets 6.1 and 6.A. In 2022, 557 \r\nanalyzes were conducted in this Unit. \r\nConsistent with target 6.B, with \r\nregard to aspects of supporting \r\nthe development of activities and \r\nprograms related to water and \r\nsanitation, the State Government \r\nhas acted in guiding and supporting \r\nmunicipalities in the construction \r\nof instruments for planning and \r\nimplementing the basic sanitation \r\npolicy in that sphere.\r\nWith regard to target 6.B, which \r\naims to support and strengthen the \r\nparticipation of local communities, \r\nprioritizing social control to improve \r\nwater and sanitation management, \r\nwe highlight the “Support for Actions \r\nof CONCIDADES” Council of Cities \r\n(CONCIDADES), an instrument \r\nof society’s participation in the \r\nformulation and implementation of \r\npublic policies related to the areas \r\nof sanitation, urban mobility and \r\nterritorial planning.",

         "44\r\nPalestinian National Voluntary Review on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda\r\nSDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable \r\n management of water and sanitation for all \r\nMeeting the basic needs of \r\nour Palestinian communities \r\nis a national priority, and the \r\nPalestinian government is \r\ncommitted to expanding access \r\nto safe water and sanitation. \r\nTo this end, the Palestinian \r\ngovernment will develop its \r\nwater management, protection \r\nand sustainable use of available \r\nresources. The government is \r\nalso committed to expanding \r\nwastewater management, \r\ntreatment, and reuse, in line with \r\nsustainable environmental and \r\nsocial commitments52. \r\nEnsuring the availability and sustainable management of \r\nwater and sanitation for all is an integral part of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the Palestinian context. As the essential need \r\nfor enhancing food security, health and wellbeing of citizens \r\n(see SDG 2, 3 and 14), and the resilience of Palestinian \r\ncommunities in the face of water confiscation and intensifying \r\nclimate change (See SDG 13), becomes more prevalent. \r\nEven though 91% of communities are connected to public \r\npiped water networks53, irregular water supply and \r\nintermittent access to piped water is widespread in both West \r\nBank and Gaza. As such, many Palestinians survive with less \r\nthan the World Health Organisation recommended water \r\nconsumption guidelines of 120 litres per day per person. The \r\naverage Palestinian connected to the water network \r\nconsumes around 78 litres a day, in some areas in the West \r\nBank; the consumption can be as little as 38 litres per day (in \r\nthe case of Jenin Governorate) and as little as 20 litres a day for \r\nPalestinian communities in Area C54.\r\nMoreover, on average, 99.7% of the Palestinian population \r\nhave access to improved unshared sanitation (99.6 % in \r\nWest Bank and 99.9% in Gaza), while 55% of Palestinians are \r\nconnected to a public sanitation system with 36.7% in the \r\nWest Bank and 85.5% in the Gaza Strip; 94.6% in refugee \r\ncamps; 60.6% of urban areas while only 12.2% of rural areas55. \r\nWastewater quantities generated in Palestine are estimated \r\nat 150 MCM, of which only 60% are collected. Current \r\navailability of centralized and decentralized wastewater \r\ntreatment plants is treating only 25% of the generated \r\nwastewater, where only 1% of the treated wastewater is \r\nreused for agricultural purposes.\r\nWater is also central to Gaza’s current humanitarian crisis. \r\nSince the most recent hostilities in 2014, 1.2 million people in \r\nGaza (approximately 2/3 of Gaza’s population) have no \r\nrunning water and there is insufficient electricity to treat or \r\npump out sewage. The Coastal Aquifer, which supplies \r\nvirtually all of Gaza’s water, is being pumped at three times its \n\n45\r\n0\r\n5\r\n10\r\n15\r\n20\r\n25\r\n30\r\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\r\nPalestine West Bank Gaza\r\n0\r\n1&000&000\r\n2&000&000\r\n3&000&000\r\n4&000&000\r\n5&000&000\r\n6&000&000\r\n7&000&000\r\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\r\n\bmporte\u0014 \u0005nergy locally source\u0014 \u000fotal\r\nsustainable capacity resulting in seawater and raw sewage \r\ncontamination. Currently, 97% of the water drawn from the \r\naquifer is undrinkable, and only 10% of Gaza’s population has \r\naccess to safe drinking water. As a result, contaminated water \r\nand a lack of sanitation are responsible for 26% of all disease \r\nin Gaza (See SDG 3). Without proper treatment, the pollution \r\nwill become irreversible by 2022. As a result, 85% of Palestinian \r\nin Gaza are reliant on private desalination services, which \r\ncharge up to five times the cost of water from municipal \r\nnetworks. Less than half of these services are licensed, and \r\n68% of water from these services is contaminated throughout \r\neither production, transportation or home storage. \r\nKey challenges to clean water and sanitation:\r\nAfter the Israeli military occupation in 1967, Israel annulled all \r\nland and water-related arrangements that existed prior to the \r\noccupation, and illegally granted itself authority of Palestine’s \r\nwater resources. As a result, developing water resources in \r\nArea C, including wells and rainwater storage as well as \r\nconnecting to the water network requires a permit from the \r\nIsraeli occupation named “Civil Administration”. The water \r\nnetwork for Palestinians living in the West Bank is outdated, \r\ninefficient, and in urgent need of upgrading. As much as 34% \r\nof piped water in Palestine is lost to leakages due to an old \r\nand inefficient network. Palestinian communities not \r\nconnected to the grid, or facing intermittent supply, are \r\nforced to buy tanked water from private dealers at a hugely \r\ninflated cost. \r\nIsrael’s control over the West Bank’s water allocation has resulted \r\nin the Palestinian share being capped at 1995 levels, despite a \r\ndoubling in population size. This has resulted in a grossly \r\nunequal and increasingly widening distribution gap between \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians. While Israel initially controlled 83% of \r\nthe water coming from the shared Mountain Aquifer (with \r\nPalestine receiving 17%), the percentage allocated to Palestine \r\nhas shrunk to 13% while Israel’s allocation has ballooned to 87% \r\ndespite 85% of water refilling the Mountain Aquifer occurs \r\nwithin Palestine. This unjust and unequal access to water \r\nseriously violates international law and hinders the development \r\nof the Palestinian economy, particularly the agricultural sector. \r\nThe unequal water distribution has resulted in a grave financial \r\nburden for the Palestinian government, where to meet the \r\ncurrent and future population needs; water must be purchased \r\nfrom the Israeli national water carrier. Palestine purchases 70 \r\nMCM annually, where this number is expected to increase to \r\n106 MCM by the year 2022. This gross inequality has also \r\nresulted in huge disparities in water consumption between \r\nillegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Palestinians. Average \r\nconsumption in illegal Israeli settlements is an enormous 369 \r\nlitres per day. In total, the 636.5 thousand Israeli settlers living in \r\nthe West Bank consume more water than the Palestinian \r\npopulation of 2.88 million56. \r\nPoor wastewater treatment by Israeli settlers, and the \r\ninability for Palestine to strengthen national wastewater \r\ntreatment due to the Israeli occupation restrictions, poses \r\nsignificant threats to Palestinian health and environment, \r\nwhere according to the Palestinian Water Authority, 91mcm \r\na year of wastewater flow in the West Bank, and illegal \r\nsettlements produce twice the wastewater of Palestinian \r\ncommunities, constituting 38% of wastewater that flows in \r\nthe West Bank. In addition, 5.5mcm of settlements’ \r\nwastewater flows untreated into West Bank streams and \r\nvalleys per year. \r\nIn Gaza the siege has disabled the government and its \r\npartners to construct the necessary water desalination and \r\nwastewater treatment facilities to increase the access of \r\nclean water and sanitation for the 1.9 million citizens in Gaza. \r\nIn some cases where the necessary infrastructure has been \r\nbuilt, for example the largest seawater desalination plant \r\nconstructed last year, suffers from the lack of electricity in \r\nthe Gaza Strip (see SDG 7). The result of the severely \r\ninterrupted electricity supply has hindered the capacity of \r\ndesalination and water treatment centres to operate at the \r\nnecessary capacity.\r\nImplementing The SDGS: PLANET \n\n46\r\nPalestinian National Voluntary Review on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda\r\nGovernment efforts:\r\nThe Palestinian Water Authority leads the water, sanitation and \r\nhygiene sector through the development of the National Water \r\nand Wastewater Sector Strategy (2013- 2032). The National \r\nWater Strategy provides the planning and management \r\nframework necessary for the protection, conservation, and \r\nsustainable management of water resources. The strategy aims \r\nto reinforce the Palestinian’s approach to sustainable water \r\nresources management by ensuring that all arms of government \r\nwork together in the pursuit of shared water resources \r\nmanagement goals. As part of this strategy, the government \r\nhas established a framework for the coordinated development, \r\nregulation and financial sustainability of water supply and \r\nwastewater services to ensure concerted efforts towards \r\nimproved water and wastewater system management, \r\nrehabilitation and maintenance.\r\nLooking forward:\r\nAs part of its efforts to implement this goal, and in coordination \r\nwith its partners to ensure the right of all citizens to have \r\naccess to safe water and sanitation services. The Government \r\nwill focus its efforts on improving the overall, integrated and \r\nsustainable management of water resources through the \r\ndevelopment and expansion of water infrastructure, the \r\ncompletion of the legal and regulatory framework for the \r\nestablishment and operation of water providers, and the \r\npromotion of water conservation programs. To strengthen \r\nwastewater management, treatment and reuse, the \r\ngovernment will develop and expand the infrastructure of \r\nsewage networks as well as build, rehabilitating and further \r\nexpanding existing wastewater treatment plants to increase \r\ndependence on treated water for agriculture.",

         "96 97\r\n7.7.4 SDG 7: Ensure access to a\r\nfordable, \r\nreliable, sustainable and modern \r\nenergy for all\r\nSignificant progress was made in target 7.2 (by \r\n2030, increase substantially the share of renewable \r\nenergy in the global energy mix) and target 7.3 \r\n(by 2030, double the global rate of improvement \r\nin energy e\r\nfciency), which is confirmed by \r\nthe participants in the VNR consultations who \r\nsingled out renewable energy sources and energy efciency as an area of importance for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the environment in which the \r\ngreatest progress was made.\r\nThe national target of 33% of final energy \r\nconsumption from renewable sources by 2020 \r\nwas achieved and exceeded. Indicator 7.2.1 – The \r\nshare of renewable energy within the total final \r\nenergy consumption in the period that the VNR \r\nrefers to was constantly above the level of 35%: the \r\nminimum (37.7%) and maximum (43.8%) values \r\nwere recorded in 2019 and 2020, respectively. \r\nIn the period 2016–2021, several energy e\r\nfciency \r\nprogrammes were implemented that targeted \r\nvarious sectors, including the residential and public \r\nsectors. The values of indicator 7.3.1 – Energy \r\nintensity – were not reported in the NSSD 2030 \r\nmonitoring process.\r\nIndicator 7.1.1 – Proportion of the population with \r\naccess to electricity – is available for 2018 (MICS) \r\nand amounted to 99.9%, and 96.4% in Roma \r\nsettlements. Within the process of reporting \r\non NSSD 2030 implementation, indicator 7.1.2 \r\n(Proportion of the population with primary reliance \r\non clean fuels and technology for cooking, heating \r\nand lighting) was calculated at 28% in 2018.\r\nDespite these successes, certain challenges remain \r\nin the energy sector; attention to some of them \r\nis drawn by the NGOs that contributed to the \r\npreparation of the Second VNR (Box 7-10).\r\nTarget 7.2: TPP Pljevlja produces 40% of the electricity required to meet the needs of Montenegro and is the largest \r\nsingle polluter in the country. More progress is needed in finding alternatives to electricity generation, in order to en\r\n-\r\nsure energy stability and, on the other hand, preserve human health and the environment. The ecological reconstruc\r\n-\r\ntion of TPP Pljevlja turned out to be a poorly planned process, with an increase in costs of \r\n€15 million and delays, and \r\nthe management showed negligence and incompetence in planning that process.\r\nIn addition to the existing and planned energy sources based on wind energy, significantly more attention needs to be \r\npaid to the use of the large potentials of solar energy. Incentive measures in the form of loans for the installation of \r\nsolar panels for sanitary hot water in households did not yield adequate results, but that does not mean that incentive \r\nmeasures should be abolished. Instead, the problems need to be considered and the measures improved. A large num\r\n-\r\nber of family/small hotels and the hospitality sector in general are a significant target group when it comes to the use \r\nof this type of energy. In addition, we expect that the planned projects for obtaining energy from solar sources will be \r\nmore dynamic. The goals of our country when it comes to renewable energy sources are to be more ambitious, not only \r\nbecause we are signatories to various agreements, but also because they will contribute to better living conditions. \r\nTarget 7.3: Energy e\r\nfciency in all sectors has to be our priority. Rationalization of energy use and incentives for house\r\n-\r\nholds can significantly reduce our energy requirements, reduce pollution and mitigate climate change. The country’s \r\ngoals in this area need to be much more ambitious. Given that residential buildings in Montenegro are relatively old, \r\nand therefore energy-ine\r\nfcient, additional investments in energy e\r\nfciency are needed. Energy e\r\nfciency measures \r\nare implemented through a call for interest-free loans announced by the relevant ministry, as well as through a call \r\npublished by the Eco Fund, which partially subsidizes the implementation of energy e\r\nfciency measures for individuals \r\nand legal entities.\r\nTarget 7.a (Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology): Informa\r\n-\r\ntion on cooperation in the field of energy e\r\nfciency and renewable energy sources at the international level is hardly \r\navailable and not su\r\nfciently visible (promoted).\r\nThe national target of\r\n33%\r\nof final energy consumption\r\nfrom renewable sources\r\nby 2020 was achieved\r\nand exceeded\r\nProportion of the\r\npopulation with\r\naccess to electricity is\r\navailable for 2018 (MICS)\r\nand amounted to 99.9%\r\nand 96.4% in Roma\r\nsettlements",

         "70\r\n4.8 Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \r\nfull and productive employment, and decent work for all\r\nMain messages\r\nSouth Africa faces prolonged slow economic growth and high levels of \r\nunemployment (particularly among women and youth).\r\nA wide range of interventions to improve the business climate, and a \r\nfriendlier business environment have been launched. These include \r\nincrease spatial integration and the promotion of innovation. \r\nThe current situation\r\nSouth Africa is the most advanced economy (in terms of technological, \r\nfinancial and physical infrastructure) and the most sophisticated private sector \r\non the continent and the only African member of the G20. It is also the most \r\nindustrialized and diversified economy in Africa and one of the four upper \r\nmiddle-income economy.20 Its foreign exchange reserves are of the largest \r\nand it has the largest pension fund asset-base in Africa. \r\nHowever, growth in the past decade remained below the levels required for a \r\nrapid transformation of living standards. In the most recent period, growth \r\nremained subdued.\r\n 20 Others are Botswana, Gabon and Mauritius. \n\n71\r\nThe fall in international commodity prices from 2012–2016 is estimated to have \r\ncost 4 percentage points of GDP (World Bank, 2017). Moreover, the South \r\nAfrican economy lacked the dynamism to shift resources quickly in response \r\nto changes in prices, due to remaining oligopolies and gaps in physical \r\ninfrastructure and education that create large productivity differentials across \r\nsectors (IMF, 2018). Infrastructure bottlenecks, including severe power \r\noutages and transport difficulties, together with labour-management conflicts, \r\nhave impaired productivity.\r\nTo address these, two sets of changes have been introduced: \r\n9 Major changes have now been made to the competition laws to address \r\nboth monopolies and high levels of economic concentration; these changes \r\nwill come into effect between July and November 2019; and\r\n9 A new R100 billion Infrastructure Fund has been put in place to co-fund \r\npublic infrastructure.\r\nThe need for fiscal consolidation to contain increasing levels of public debt,\r\nwhich exceed 50 per cent of GDP (IMF, 2018) has reduced the stimulus that \r\ngovernment policy can offer to demand. Some commentators have contended \r\nthat uncertainty over government policy, in particular related to the debates \r\nover land reform, investor rights and petroleum and gas exploration, have \r\nrestrained private sector investment (World Bank 2016b). \r\nTo address these, greater focus on policy certainty and engagement with the \r\nprivate sector and organised labour, characterises the approach of the new \r\nAdministration. \r\nThe country avoided a recession during the period 2014-2016 when other \r\nmineral-exporting countries faced recessionary conditions, largely due to \r\nsignificant investment in public infrastructure. Employment rose for the period \r\n2014 to 2018, by 1.2 million new jobs. From about 2016, infrastructure \r\ninvestment tapered off. The economy went into a technical recession during \r\n2017. While the country has come out of the technical recession, growth \r\nremains constrained, in 2018 GDP increased by less than one per cent, or \r\nbelow the 1.6 per cent rise in population, and employment levels declined.\r\nKey limitations on growth in manufacturing include inadequate infrastructure, \r\ndeclines in expenditures on innovation, a poor climate for entrepreneurship \r\nand an insufficient supply of the sophisticated skills required for a modern, \r\ncompetitive economy. There is a particular lack of education in STEM fields. \r\nFor example, only six of every 1,000 children who started Grade 1 in 2001 \r\nchose to pursue a STEM qualification at a tertiary level, only three of whom \r\nwould complete the qualification.\n\n72\r\nFigure 9. GDP growth has declined since the beginning of this decade \r\nSource: Statistics South Africa database.\r\nA particular dynamic of the SA labour market is the simultaneous increase in \r\nemployment and unemployment levels, even in periods where employment \r\ngrowth exceeds that of population growth. The main reason for this is the \r\nsignificant growth in the size of the labour force, ascribed to urbanisation as \r\npeople leave subsistence economic activity, inward migration and greater \r\ngender participation levels, all of which will greatly assist long-term growth but \r\nplace significant short-term pressures on the labour market. \r\nTo illustrate the above remarks, it is worth noting that:\r\n9 The labour absorption rate, such as the number of persons of working age \r\nout of every 100 who are employed, grew from 41.9 to 42.6, in the period \r\nbetween September 2010 (the low point of the impact of the global financial \r\ncrisis) and march 2019\r\n9 In the same period, unemployment rates grew from 25.4% to 27.6%.\r\nUnemployment rates are particularly high for women (29.6 per cent in 2017, \r\ncompared to 25.7 per cent for men) and for youth aged 15 to 24 (53.4 per \r\ncent). Moreover, unemployment rates differ dramatically by population group. \r\nIn 2016, Unemployment rate for black Africans was 30.2 per cent, compared \r\nto 12 per cent for Indians/Asians and 6.9 per cent for the white population \r\ngroup (Figure 10). \n\n73\r\nFigure 10: Unemployment rate by population group \r\nSource: Stats SA, 2017\r\nThe policy framework\r\nThe NDP aims to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality through an increase \r\nin inclusive economic growth (NPC, 2012). Going forward, the following \r\ninterventions are being undertaken: (beyond those discussed under other \r\nSDG targets): \r\nx Given the key role that small businesses play in stimulating economic \r\nactivity and employment, as well advancing broad-based empowerment, \r\na number of small business initiatives are being scaled-up. \r\nx The Framework Agreement, reached during the 2018 Presidential Jobs \r\nSummit, commits social partners to undertake concrete steps to avoid \r\nretrenchment and support companies in distress. This will be combined \r\nwith a Rapid Response Team of experts to assist struggling businesses. \r\nIn addition, the Training Layoff Scheme will be immediately revived and \r\nimproved to mitigate job losses. In line with these commitments, focus \r\nshould be placed on the export of manufactured goods and trade in \r\nservices.\r\nx Together with a focus on exports, measures should be taken to increase \r\nlocal demand by, inter alia, increasing the proportion of local goods and \r\nservices procured both by the Government and the private sector. \r\nGovernment is rolling-out a local procurement strategy to give effect to \r\nthis goal.\r\n30.20%\r\n22.90%\r\n12.00%\r\n6.90%\r\n0%\r\n5%\r\n10%\r\n15%\r\n20%\r\n25%\r\n30%\r\n35%\r\nBlack African Coloured Indians/Asians Whites\n\n74\r\nx Interventions are being developed to support spatial integration by \r\nimproving connections between the ‘buffer zones’ between townships \r\nand economic centres, upgrading informal settlements, and building \r\nlower-income housing in the leafy suburbs and city centres. Land \r\nacquisition programmes should be coordinated between relevant \r\nmunicipalities, provincial and national departments. \r\nx South Africa has the resources, talent and youth to embrace digital \r\nindustrialization. Government and regulatory agencies will be to \r\ncollaborating closely with business and civil society in order to \r\nparticipate in the digital economy.\r\nx Current programmes are being expanded towards an inclusive and \r\nresponsive system of innovation that is able to support inventions that \r\noriginate outside the realms of formal institutions of innovation. These \r\nprogrammes include the Government’s Grassroots Innovation \r\nProgramme and the Youth Technology Innovation Programme, as well \r\nas strengthening of the role of intermediary organizations in the \r\ninnovation system to achieve inclusion.\r\nAs a sign of the Government commitment to promoting job-rich growth, the \r\nPresident signed into law the following in December 2018: National \r\nMinimum Wage, Basic Condition of Employment Act, Labour Relations \r\nAmendment, Labour Laws Amendment, Unemployment Insurance \r\nAmendment, and Extension of Security of Tenue Amendment Acts. \r\nThis regard, there are extensive policy, legal and institutional frameworks in \r\nplace to promote decent jobs and rapid economic growth in the country. The \r\nmain challenge is enforcement. The new regime is committed to \r\naccelerated implementation of existing policy, legal and institutional \r\nframeworks for job-rich growth. In particular, we are committed to reforming \r\nour public enterprises to serve as growth accelerator, to leveraging the \r\npower of our private sector and deepen skill development for youth. While \r\nthe Government is ready to bridge the implementation gap, calling on the \r\nprivate sector and all social partners to join in turning this challenge in to \r\nopportunities for inclusive growth and development. The recent effort by \r\nthe Global Compact Network South Africa, in turning the SDGs into \r\nbusiness opportunities, in using the SDGs interconnectedness to create \r\neconomic ecosystem impact and in promoting responsible businesses –\r\nespecially in re-imaging corporate leadership, thriving communities and a \r\nhealthy environment- in the country is highly commendable. Primate sector \r\nmust use business to promote profit, people and planet simultaneously –\r\nthey are mutually inclusive.",

Over 65% of the business in the market is\r\nexport-oriented. It will take more than a year to finish visiting the whole International\r\nTrade Mart given 3 minutes per booth by 8 hours each day. The Yiwu market has\r\nattracted more than 20 multinational retail groups such as Wal-Mart, Metro and more\r\nthan 30 well-known domestic supermarket chains. More than 10 million domestic and\r\noverseas merchants come to Yiwu for purchase annually, and more than 15,000\r\noverseas merchants from more than 100 countries and regions reside in the city. Yiwu\r\nhas provided trade services to 300,000 small and medium-sized enterprises around the\r\nglobe, with a total of 580,000 market entities, accounting for 1\r\n/13 of the total number of\r\nall those in the whole Zhejiang Province.\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n25\r\nYiwu International Trade Mart\r\n4.1.2 Overall Progress\r\nThe Yiwu small commodities market, founded in 1982, is one of the earliest\r\nprofessional markets in China. From “Trading Sugar for Feather” business practice to\r\nbecome the “World Supermarket”, and from the first generation of “Yiwu Small\r\nCommodities Market” to the sixth generation of “Yiwu International Trade Mart”, the\r\nYiwu market has expanded its network from the surrounding areas to China and\r\nbeyond as a whole, and is hailed by the vast number of domestic and foreign\r\nmerchants as “a sea of consumer goods and a paradise for shoppers”.\r\nEvolving from the peddling business of “Trading Sugar for Feather”, the Yiwu\r\nmarket has developed into a spontaneous small commodities market in the late 1970s.\r\nWith the deepening of China’s reform and opening up, Yiwu’s small commodities\r\nmarket has been keeping up with economic globalization and China’s international\r\ntrade reforms. In 2020, Yiwu was approved by the State Council as part of the\n\nUN SDGs\r\n26\r\nZhejiang Free Trade Zone (FTZ for short). Based on the development of Yiwu’s sixth\r\ngeneration market featuring new-type import business, on-and-offline digital linkage,\r\nglobal business layout, and abundant goods with advanced logistics systems and\r\nleveraging Yiwu’s inclusion in the FTZ, merchants all over the world can freely and\r\neasily engage in international trade. The Yiwu market is exploring to shape up new\r\ntypes of import, be bolstered by digital trade, be supported by information services,\r\nand set up experiential functions, and going all out to empower and realize the\r\nstrategic transformation of “two-wheel-driven development by import and export;\r\ninterconnectivity of domestic and overseas markets”.\r\nAn enterpriser of Yiwu market is talking with a foreign businessman\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n27\r\n4.1.3 Specific Measures\r\n(1) Promoting rapid market development through integrated\r\ndomestic and foreign trade\r\nAfter years of accumulation and development, the Yiwu market has formed a\r\ndevelopment model that integrates domestic and foreign trade as a whole, setting a\r\ngood paradigm of interactive and coordinated development of domestic and foreign\r\ntrade. At the end of 2001, when China officially joined the WTO, Yiwu seized the\r\nopportunity in time to develop foreign trade. By expanding the international markets\r\nthrough various means, such as investing overseas, attracting international buyers,\r\ncooperating with foreign markets, and holding expos, Yiwu has successfully exported\r\nproducts to 219 countries and regions, with the proportion of export accounting for\r\n65%. Due to the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, Yiwu changed its market\r\nstrategy from “Emphasizing Foreign Trade over Domestic Trade” to “Developing\r\nDomestic and Foreign Trade Simultaneously”. To take more domestic market share,\r\nYiwu China Commodities City Group has rolled out a series of policies and measures\r\nto expand the domestic market, such as providing sourcing agents and delivery\r\nservice. Yiwu China Commodities City Logistics Delivery Co., Ltd establishes ties\r\nwith other domestic markets, building domestic delivery network in Helongjiang,\r\nSichuan provinces, Xinjiang, etc. Through such a network, market enterprisers can\r\nexpand domestic trade.\r\nAfter nearly 40 years of market development, Yiwu has formed a domestic sales\r\nnetwork covering large and medium-sized cities across the country and a foreign trade\r\nnetwork covering 219 countries and regions around the world. Yiwu has equipped\r\nitself with an advanced and efficient logistics delivery network over the years, with\r\nmore than 2,500 domestic and international logistics enterprises in the city, forming a\r\nglobal cargo transportation and delivery network reaching more than 1,400\r\ncounty-level cities and more than 90% of prefecture-level cities in China.\n\nUN SDGs\r\n28\r\n(2) Promoting diversified development of the Yiwu market via the\r\nInternet\r\nWith the vigorous development of the Internet in China, the rapid growth of new\r\nforms of the Internet economy such as social media E-Commerce and livestreaming\r\neconomy has further diversified the Yiwu market. With its world-leading\r\nE-Commerce cluster, Yiwu’s volume of postal and express delivery services reached\r\n9.01 billion pieces in 2020, ranking first among the large and medium-sized cities in\r\nChina, accounting for about 1\r\n/10 of China’s total. Calculated by transaction volume,\r\nYiwu’s E-Commerce industry has provided 130,000 direct jobs and generated more\r\nthan 260,000 indirect jobs. In July 2018, Yiwu was officially approved as a national\r\nintegrated pilot zone for cross-border E-Commerce. Rapid development of the\r\nInternet fueled the Internet celebrity economy in Yiwu with “turning traffic into\r\nmoney” business model becoming the focus of livestreaming platforms such as\r\nDouyin, Kuaishou, and Huajiao. New marketing model of “live streaming + sales”\r\nhas thus gained recognition of Yiwu market enterprisers instantly. With the\r\nadvantages of agglomeration of good sources, sound logistics, developed\r\nE-Commerce, and hub of timely information, Yiwu market players and traditional\r\nE-Commerce enterprisers started to dabble in live streaming in 2019. At present,\r\nYiwu has attracted more than 50,000 live-streaming E-Commerce practitioners\r\nengaged in the fields such as product supply, live-streaming training, live-streaming\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n29\r\ncontent production, and influencer marketing, giving rise to the emergence of live￾streaming E-Commerce community-like villages, where both goods and online\r\ncelebrities gather.\r\nIn 2020, Yiwu’s volume of E-Commerce transactions was 312.487 billion yuan,\r\na year-on-year increase of 12.86%, including 225.399 billion yuan of domestic\r\nE-Commerce transactions, and 87.088 billion yuan of cross-border E-Commerce\r\ntransactions, representing year-on-year increases of 11.86% and 15.5% respectively.\r\nYiwu Inland Port E-commerce Town\r\n(3) Expanding import for a balanced and sustainable development of\r\nYiwu’s international trade\r\nThe ever-growing demands for foreign products among Chinese consumers\r\npresents Yiwu with the opportunity to enlarge its import trade. As it had aimed to,\r\nYiwu built a springboard for global daily consumer goods to enter China, an\r\nimportant distribution center for imported daily consumer goods in China and a key\r\nnational base for cross-border import E-Commerce, focusing on the development of\r\nsecond-and-third-tier brands of overseas consumer goods. Yiwu has now become one\r\nof China’s largest import markets with greater influence.\r\nYiwu China Imported Commodities Trade Plaza has 211 business entities with a\r\ntotal operating area of 140,000 m2\r\n, gathering 150,000 kinds of imported commodities\n\nUN SDGs\r\n30\r\nfrom more than 150 countries, and is currently the scale-leading “one-stop” imported\r\ncommodities procurement base in China, an imported commodities exhibition and\r\ntrade center integrating operation, exhibition and sales, and negotiation. Well-known\r\ndomestic cross-border E-Commerce platforms such as JD Worldwide, Kaola, Lifease,\r\nand Wonderful have opened offline physical stores there. Import service enterprises\r\nproviding import customs declaration, freight forwarding, financial services, talent\r\ntraining and supply chain services gather in Yiwu to provide highly-convenient and\r\nlow-cost import customs clearance services for import trade.\r\nYiwu started to host import expo in 2012 and promoted it into China Yiwu\r\nImported Commodities Fair in 2015, which is one of the most influential exhibitions\r\nin the field of imported daily consumer goods in China. Since 2015, Yiwu has been\r\nholding the Imported Commodities Shopping Festival before the Spring Festival\r\nevery year, which lasts for 9 days. It has become a well-known annual festival activity\r\nin the Yangtze River Delta region, attracting more than 500,000 consumers to Yiwu\r\nevery year. In 2020, Yiwu realized import transaction of 12.33 billion yuan, an\r\nincrease of 23.4%.\r\n(4) Promoting innovation-driven development through\r\nentrepreneurship and innovation\r\nIn 2019, Yiwu established the Association for Yiwu Entrepreneurship Platforms\r\nto further improve the service capability and incubation levels of urban\r\nentrepreneurship platforms, and provide entrepreneurs with better entrepreneurial\r\ninnovation services. At present, Yiwu has 24 municipal-level maker-spaces, 10\r\nmunicipal youth start-up workshops, 5 provincial-level maker-spaces, and 3\r\nprovincial-level entrepreneurial incubation demonstration bases.\r\nTo facilitate mass entrepreneurship and innovation, Yiwu issued the Yiwu\r\nEntrepreneurship Forum and Salon Activities Subsidy Measures (Trial), which\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n31\r\nencourages and guides private sector to hold entrepreneurial salons and other\r\nactivities and promote the healthy and orderly development of entrepreneurial\r\nactivities. In 2020, Yiwu held more than 50 entrepreneurial activities such as\r\nentrepreneurship salons, entrepreneurship forums, entrepreneurship competitions,\r\nwhich provided more than 4,500 entrepreneurs with services such as creative idea\r\nexchanges, resource sharing, investment and financing matchmaking.\r\nYiwu Industrial & Commercial College has actively explored the\r\nentrepreneurship education and practice for college students relying on Yiwu market,\r\ndelivering great results. The College has ranked in the top positions among higher\r\neducation institutions in China in terms of graduate entrepreneurship ratio for many\r\nconsecutive years. For example, the rates of start-ups in the years 2014 and 2016 were\r\n21.09% and 11.86% respectively, ranking first among the universities in the province.\r\nThe “Yiwu Phenomenon” in entrepreneurship education has attracted great attention.\r\nTo build a global entrepreneurial innovation base, Yiwu launched the “Run with\r\nYiwu- Global Youth Business Program” in April 2018. A total of 7 sessions have been\r\nheld so far, with nearly 300 outstanding young people from more than 60 countries\r\nparticipating in the program. This is a training program that integrates E-Commerce\r\ntrade courses, business incubation, and cultural exchanges. Through this program,\r\nparticipants from all over the world explore China’s economic miracle, hone\r\nentrepreneurial skills together, get in touch with the most cutting-edge E-Commerce\r\ndevelopment and the international markets, and talk to the most inspiring grassroots\r\nentrepreneurial stars.\r\n(5) Promoting healthy development by supporting micro, small, and\r\nmedium enterprises\r\nIn 2016, the Yiwu Municipal Government promulgated the Ten Guidelines for\r\nSupporting the Development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Promoting\n\nUN SDGs\r\n32\r\nIndustrial Transformation and Upgrading (Trial), to help enterprises expand the\r\ndevelopment space, optimize the land supply methods, reduce the land use and\r\nfinancing costs, promote standardization and upgrading, support sustainable\r\ndevelopment, promote technological transformation, enhance scientific innovation,\r\nfacilitate brand building, optimize the environment of element configuration, and\r\nsupport the development of micro, small and medium enterprises to promote\r\nindustrial transformation and upgrading.\r\nYiwu has sped up the construction of micro, small and medium enterprise parks.\r\nSince 2016, a total of 95 micro and small parks have been built in the city, gathering\r\n2,859 micro and small enterprises. Yiwu has also established a high-quality\r\ndevelopment index system for micro and small parks, focusing on the cultivation of\r\nnew driving forces. By seizing the major strategic opportunities for the integrated\r\ndevelopment of the Yangtze River Delta region, Yiwu has actively undertaken the\r\n“spillover effects” of the Shanghai-Hangzhou high-tech industries, actively\r\ncoordinated the transfer of industries from Shenzhen, and carried out the development\r\nof high-tech industrial real estate and the introduction of investments from emerging\r\nindustrial enterprises. Yiwu has given full play to the role of the market, by attracting\r\nprivate capital to participate in the construction of micro and small parks and meeting\r\nthe diversified needs of micro and small enterprises for entering the parks with\r\nabundant means of supply.\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n33\r\nYiwu High-tech Park\r\n(6) Promoting sustainable development through strategies of\r\n“Revitalizing the City through Science & Education” and\r\n“Revitalizing the City through Talents”\r\nYiwu has striven to use the best talent policies and the most efficient systems to\r\nattract talents, retain talents, and make good use of talents, making Yiwu a paradise\r\nfor high-end talents and young people at home and abroad to start a gold rush, and\r\ncreate a hot spot for mass entrepreneurship and innovation. Talents have been\r\nattracted through large-scale talent exchange conferences, school-enterprise\r\ncooperation matchmaking meetings, events for thousands of enterprises to enter a\r\nhundred universities, doctoral expert project fairs, talent project roadshow\r\nmatchmaking meetings and other activities. Yiwu has been constantly improving the\r\ninnovation and entrepreneurship policy system and attracted young talents to start\r\ntheir own businesses through the exploration of project-based entrepreneurship\r\ntraining and the promotion of the “Internet +” entrepreneurship training. In addition,\r\nYiwu has provided entrepreneurs with all-round policy support to start-up technology\r\nenterprises, talents, and team project incubation in various links such as investment\n\nUN SDGs\r\n34\r\nguidance, entrepreneurship venues, and training services. All in all, Yiwu has been\r\nstriving to create the best environment for attracting talents to “come in” and “stay”\r\nby lifting limitations on academic qualifications, work experience, and academic\r\ntitles.\r\nThe “Science and Education Section” is one of the four key construction sections\r\nof Yiwu Integrated Pilot Zone of International Trade Reform. The Shuangjiang Lake\r\nScience and Education Park spans a planned area of 6 square kilometers, focusing on\r\nthe development of higher education, vocational education, and technical research,\r\ndevelopment and incubation. School of Modern Science and Technology of China\r\nJiliang University, newly built in Yiwu, started its term in October 2020. The\r\nconstruction of the “Belt and Road”School of the University of Chinese Academy of\r\nSciences and the “One Institute and Three Bases” of Fudan University are progressing\r\nsmoothly as scheduled. Colleges and universities have been successively introduced\r\ninto Yiwu, which will play a positive role in the development of the education\r\nindustry in Yiwu, the support of the scientific and technological innovation industry,\r\nthe improvement of the talent institutions and the promotion of regional development,\r\nand will provide solid talent foundation for Yiwu to build itself into the World’s\r\nCapital of Small Commodities at a higher level.",

The proportion of employed women is the highest \r\nin the EU, yet low among foreign native women. Despite this, there are still challenges pertain￾ing to insecure employment conditions, especially within labour migration, a lack of skilled \r\nlabour in certain professions and matching problems, wage gaps between women and men, \r\nsecured right to employment and occupation for those with mental or physical disabilities, \r\nand work-related ill-health. Swedish municipalities have a great deal of responsibility in sup￾porting individuals distanced from the labour market in fnding work and occupations.\r\n* Unemployment among young people and young adults aged 18–24 has however increased in 2020.\r\n35\r\nArrow pointing up: positive development; Arrow side: development stagnated; Arrow pointing down: negative development\r\nIndicator Data for \r\nHelsingborg\r\nHelsingborg trend\r\nsince 2015\r\nOther larger cities \r\nin Sweden\r\nGross regional product (GRP), \r\nSEK/res.

Additionally, there is a long tradition of larger production industries, and the Port of Hel￾singborg is a signifcant player in Swedish imports and exports. This entails that Helsingborg \r\nshows positive economic growth and serves as an important engine for growth in Skåne. The \r\npotential for increasing Helsingborg’s signifcance in terms of national growth power is great. \r\nThis potential is fuelled by its proximity to major cities and the Danish capital Copenhagen, \r\nthe opportunities to improve communications with the continent, a thriving business sector, \r\nand the university establishment in the city. The education level among the population has ris￾en in recent years thanks to the new university presence, and there are excellent opportunities \r\nfor companies looking for skilled labour to establish themselves in the municipality. \r\nWe identify academia and the business sector as important partners in achieving sustainabil￾ity and breaking the link between economic growth and environmental destruction. Instead, \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development must be shown as interdependent. We have \r\nalso shown this in recent years. Helsingborg has had economic growth and at the same time \r\nput up a high standard for environmental work and has been awarded as Sweden’s most en￾vironmentally friendly municipality four times in a row (#1 2017 -2020, #2 2021).\r\nOne of our primary challenges in achieving the SDG 8 involves, as it does for many other \r\nSwedish municipalities, the fact that the same taxes must provide for a growing need of more \r\nand high-quality service to the citizens in form of more schools, more culture and activities, \r\nmore care of the elderly and sick etc. \r\nLeave no one behind\r\nEven if economic growth is high and Helsingborg’s economic situation is good as a whole, \r\nthere are still groups who have not reaped the benefts of this growth. As is the case in many \r\nother larger cities in Sweden, unemployment and long-term unemployment is higher among \r\nresidents with a low level of education and among those with a foreign background, especially \r\nwomen born in other countries outside of Europe. Unemployment is generally higher among \r\nyoung people, but prior to the pandemic, we started seeing some improvement. Young people \r\nwho have not fnished upper-secondary school are having the most trouble fnding employ￾ment. There is a mismatch between the education programmes that are popular and the \r\nareas where a labour injection is needed.\r\nThe proportion of gainfully employed had increased slightly since 2015, with a small differ￾ence between men and women. Individuals born outside Sweden make up around 30% of the \r\npopulation in Helsingborg, and unemployment rates are higher among those born abroad, \r\nwhich means that Helsingborg has a lower percentage of gainfully employed residents com￾pared to other cities with a larger proportion of residents born outside Sweden. Increasing the \r\nproportion of gainfully employed individuals is a very pressing matter in order to successfully \r\nimprove people’s perception of quality of life.\n\nVoluntary local review of Helsingborg Voluntary local review of Helsingborg\r\nA GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE ARE \r\nTESTING IN HELSINGBORG\r\nSustainable procurement – promoting fair working \r\nconditions, sustainable products and production.\r\nThe city’s procurement activities shall be conducted on sustainable principles with informed \r\nconsumption to protect the rights of workers in the second and third lines and contribute to \r\nsustainable production as a major consumer. Our high level of consumption, both private and \r\npublic, is a major part of our climate impact. Goods can also contain hazardous chemicals, \r\nand services may be provided under unacceptable working conditions. As major purchasers, \r\nmunicipalities have many opportunities to steer developments in a sustainable direction.\r\nOne example in Helsingborg is how the city’s purchasing unit sets requirements for items \r\nsuch as toys and sporting equipment – materials that children and young people will come \r\ninto contact with. When we specifed in our procurement agreement that gym mats may not \r\ncontain phthalates (plasticisers, chemicals that are hormone-disruptive and carcinogenic), \r\na Swedish supplier delivered this type of mat for the very frst time. It is not uncommon for \r\nsmall children to sleep on these type of mats in preschool. The supplier can now offer this \r\nmat to buyers all over Sweden. The city has conducted tests to ensure that the mats no longer \r\ncontain these hazardous substances. If a city sets requirements, we must also ensure that \r\nthese demands are met! \r\n37\n\nVoluntary local review of Helsingborg Voluntary local review of Helsingborg",

         "35\r\nSingapore is investing in research and innovation to \r\nstrengthen our economic fundamentals and develop \r\nengines of growth, as envisioned in the Singapore \r\nEconomy 2030 Vision. We focus on three aspects: \r\n(a) building and strengthening infrastructure; (b) \r\ntransforming the economy through innovation; and \r\n(c) fostering an inclusive environment for the growth \r\nof SMEs. \r\nPushing the Boundaries \r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore supported \r\nthe aviation and maritime sectors to safeguard our \r\nstatus as a connectivity hub through packages such as \r\nthe Aviation Sector Assistance Package, One Aviation \r\nSupport Package, One Aviation Resilience Package, \r\nand MaritimeSG Together Package. Domestically, by \r\nproviding annual subsidies to run public transport \r\nservices and supporting the wages of public transport \r\nworkers, the Government ensured that Singapore’s \r\npublic transport system remained reliable, affordable, \r\nand fnancially sustainable. \r\nFor the aviation sector, we took the opportunity to \r\nreview the design of the Changi Airport Terminal 5 \r\n(T5) project to make it more modular, and enhance \r\nresilience and sustainability. T5 will be operational \r\naround the mid-2030s and is expected to provide an \r\nadditional handling capacity of 50 million passengers \r\nannually. For the maritime sector, Tuas Port was \r\noffcially opened on 1 September 2022. When fully \r\noperational in the 2040s, Tuas Port will be the world’s \r\nlargest fully automated port, capable of handling \r\nalmost double its current volume.\r\nFor land transport, our rail network will expand by \r\n50% over the next decade, to reach 360km by the early \r\n2030s. This will bring us towards our aim of increasing \r\npeak-period public transport journeys completed by \r\nWalk-Cycle-Ride modes under 45 minutes from 70% \r\ntoday to 90% by 2040. We are working with Malaysia \r\non the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System \r\nLink, which is slated to commence service by end-2026.\r\nSustainable Industrialisation Supported \r\nby Innovation\r\nSustained investments in R&D and innovation are a key \r\npillar of Singapore’s economic development strategy. \r\nWith over 4,000 technology start-ups, the Global \r\nStartup Ecosystem Index 2022 ranked Singapore as \r\n1st in Asia and 7th globally. Business expenditure on \r\nR&D grew from S$5.5 billion (≈US$3.9 billion) in 2018 \r\nto S$6.6 billion (≈US$4.7 billion) in 2020. \r\nIndustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\r\n34\r\nSUSTAINABLE\r\nDEVELOPMENT GOAL 9:\r\nBuild Resilient Infrastructure, Promote \r\nInclusive and Sustainable Industrialisation \r\nand Foster Innovation\r\nAn integrated and sustainable land transport network \r\nthrough Walk-Cycle-Ride modes\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, our R&D capabilities \r\nin healthcare and biomedical sciences contributed \r\nto our response. A*STAR’s Experimental Drug \r\nDevelopment Centre collaborated with the Diagnostics \r\nDevelopment Hub, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and \r\nbiotechnology company Mirxes to develop the \r\nFortitude COVID-19 test kit, the frst lab diagnostic kit \r\nto receive Provisional Authorisation from Singapore’s \r\nHealth Science Authority for clinical use. The Fortitude \r\nkit has been deployed in Singapore and more than 40 \r\nother countries. \r\nResearch and innovation have contributed to our \r\nsustainability efforts. For example, Singapore-based \r\nwater analytics frm Visenti developed a smart \r\nsensor, WaterWiSe, to continuously monitor water \r\nquality and leakages in pipelines. The sensor was \r\ndeveloped through pilot trials jointly conducted with \r\nPUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, and is now \r\ndeployed across over 321 locations in Singapore.\r\nUnder the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) \r\n2025 Plan, the Government remains committed to \r\ninvesting in research, innovation, and enterprise at \r\nabout 1% of Singapore’s GDP over 2021-2025, or \r\nabout S$25 billion (≈US$18 billion). The RIE2025 \r\nPlan has three focus areas. First, tackling a spectrum \r\nof national needs to support economic growth and \r\nindustry transformation such as in low-carbon \r\nhydrogen. Second, sustaining support for basic \r\nresearch through a portfolio approach for research \r\nfunding. Third, scaling up innovation and enterprise \r\nplatforms to strengthen capabilities.\r\nFoster an Inclusive Environment for SMEs\r\nSingapore continues to step up efforts to strengthen \r\nthe core capabilities of our local enterprises. We have \r\nset up Centres of Innovation (COIs)21 to assist SMEs \r\nwith their technology and innovation ambitions. From \r\n2016 to 2020, COIs have engaged about 3,000 SMEs. \r\nThese engagements have resulted in approximately \r\n300 innovation projects.\r\nThe Government has increased the support for local \r\nSMEs with respect to R&D and innovation activities. \r\nMore SMEs will be able to tap on the research \r\ncapabilities of over 80 centres undertaking innovation \r\nprojects across fve pilot sectors: agri-tech, construction, \r\nfood manufacturing, precision engineering and retail.\r\nThe Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading \r\nprogramme, has provided for the secondment of \r\nmore than 1,000 A*STAR research scientists and \r\nengineers to support over 1,000 local SMEs in product \r\ndevelopment. Enterprise Singapore, the Government \r\nagency championing enterprise development, has \r\nenhanced its Innovation Advisors Programme to \r\npartner industry veterans with SMEs to commercialise \r\ntheir research and translate their innovations into new \r\nproducts and services.\r\nThe Government has also set up Innovation Partner \r\nfor Impact Singapore, which serves as a neutral \r\nintermediary to accelerate the innovation process of \r\nenterprises through access to its global innovation \r\necosystem and advisory services.\r\n21 There are currently 11 COIs which are set up in partnership with selected polytechnics and research institutes. They cover aquaculture, \r\nenergy, electronics, supply chain management, environment and water, food, complementary health products, precision engineering, built \r\nenvironment, beauty and personal care, and urban agriculture industries. \n\n36\r\nTRANSITION TO A LOW-CARBON FUTURE\r\nTransitioning to a low-carbon future poses new \r\nchallenges. Companies will need to deepen \r\nsustainability capabilities to remain competitive. \r\nIndustries would need to invest in emerging \r\ntechnologies to decarbonise and reduce emissions \r\nsignifcantly.\r\nChallenges\r\nRISING COST PRESSURES \r\nCOVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine confict, and the \r\nincreasing cost of electricity and supplies have \r\nsignifcantly increased business costs. This makes \r\nit challenging for businesses to invest resources to \r\ninnovate and transition towards low-carbon, more \r\nsustainable business operations. \r\nSUSTAINABILITY\r\nOur Green Economy Strategy focuses on three thrusts: \r\n(a) greening our businesses and industry and shifting \r\nto renewable energy; (b) capturing green growth \r\nopportunities; and (c) equipping workers for the green \r\neconomy.\r\nOpportunities\r\nDIGITALISATION\r\nDigitalisation is a global trend that will continue to \r\nchange the way we live, work and play. Singapore is \r\nactively supporting companies’ digitalisation journeys \r\nto improve their productivity and help them change \r\ntheir business models.\r\nFuture Challenges and Opportunities \r\nTuas Port, an automated and intelligent port, \r\nwill be a critical engine that drives the Singapore \r\neconomy, and reinforces our status as an \r\ninternational maritime centre. The Maritime and \r\nPort Authority of Singapore (MPA) is working \r\nwith port operators to drive the adoption \r\nof digital technologies at Tuas Port. Digital \r\ninnovations such as MPA’s digitalPORT@SGTM \r\nwill enhance effciency of port operations and \r\nreduce the turnaround time of ships, while the \r\nNext Generation Vessel Traffc Management \r\nSystem will provide accurate, real-time \r\nsituational awareness of shipping traffc. \r\nSustainability is also a key design feature of \r\nTuas Port. Besides electrifed equipment and \r\nautomated guided vehicles which reduce carbon \r\nemissions by about 50% compared to current \r\ndiesel prime movers, green buildings, smart grid \r\nsolutions and battery energy storage systems \r\nwill be developed to optimise energy usage.",

Targets for 2030 have been set in \r\nthe NSDP M&E Framework, however baseline information and data collection have not yet been established. \r\nIt is expected that this information will be available by the 2020 NSDP Stock-Take. \r\nSummary\r\nIn summary promoting building a resilient infrastructure with sustainable industrialization is an important \r\ndevelopment objective for both the SDGs and the NSDP. Monitoring local production provides important \r\ninsight into the success of local business (agriculture and manufacturing). Legislation regarding building codes \r\nand other infrastructure development assists business development by providing the capacity for strong \r\ninfrastructure (roads and buildings) that will only help the local economy become more productive. \r\nAdditionally, increasing the budget for ongoing asset management will help to ensure sufficient funding for \r\nmaintenance and repairs. The NSDP indicators and targets, in alignment with the SDG 9 indicators provide a \r\nsufficient basis to monitor progress moving forward. However, with the information currently available it is \r\ndifficult to assess progress at this time",

         "111\r\n4.1.3 Goal 10. Reduced Inequality\r\nThis chapter focuses on the indicators in Goal 10 of Reducing Inequality. The \r\nanalysis will be focused on selected indicators, which are (i) Gini ratio, (ii) Percentage of \r\npopulation living under the national poverty line, (iii) Number of districts that are no \r\nlonger underdeveloped, (iv) Number of underdeveloped villages, (v) Number of \r\nindependent villages, (vi) Average of economic growth in underdeveloped districts, (vii) \r\nPercentage of poor people living in underdeveloped districts, (viii) Proportion of \r\npopulation living below 50% of median income, and (ix) Proportion of members of the \r\nnational social security for workers.\r\nInclusive economic growth is an integral part of efforts for equitable development. \r\nThese efforts include reducing inequality between income groups through poverty \r\neradication and improved public services, as well as reducing regional inequality through \r\nconnectivity and maritime affairs. \r\nIn the 2015-2019 National Medium-Term Development Plan, efforts in achieving \r\nequitable development to reduce inequality between income groups include the following \r\npolicies: (1) Development of a comprehensive social security system, (2) Improvement of \r\nbasic public services for the poor, (3) Development of sustainable livelihood for the poor \r\nthrough employment distribution and entrepreneurship. Reducing regional inequality is \r\nfocused on affirmative policies in underdeveloped regions, villages and rural areas to \r\nensure development can serve all layers of society.\r\nA. Trend Analysis \r\n1. Gini Ratio\r\nIn the last four decades, the Gini ratio measuring inequality in Indonesia has shown \r\ndynamic fluctuations, in accordance with the dynamic changes in socio-economic aspects \r\n(Figure 57). Around the 1970s, the increase in inequality was caused by improved access \r\nto education and infrastructure in Indonesia. Around the 1980s, inequality declined \r\nconsistently due to the expansion of the agriculture sector and massive economic growth, \r\nespecially in the rural areas. \r\nFrom the late 1980s to 1996, the Gini ratio experienced an increase due to growth \r\nin financial and banking sectors as well as services, which are closely related to high￾skilled workers. From 1998 to 1999, the Gini ratio decreased due to the Asian Financial \r\nCrisis. Then, the economy being supported by a commodity boom started growing, \r\nfollowed by an increased Gini ratio which later decreased due to the 2008 Global Financial \r\nCrisis. In relation to financial or economic crises in general, the same pattern is found in \r\nmany other countries, so crises almost always reduce inequality (Milanovic, 2016). After \r\nthe Global Financial Crisis, inequality has consistently increased and reached its peak of \r\n0,41 in 2011. \n\n112\r\nFigure 57. Long Term Inequality Trend (Gini Ratio), 1976-2018\r\nAlthough the Indonesian Gini ratio was stagnant from 2011 to 2014, it has decreased \r\nconsistently from 2015 to 2018, reaching 0.384 recently. The same pattern applies for \r\ninequality in urban and rural areas albeit with different figures. Urban figures are higher \r\nthan those in rural areas. The peak Gini ratio in urban areas was 0.433 and in rural areas \r\nin 2014. After that, the Gini ratio has decreased to 0.391 and 0.319 for urban and rural \r\nareas respectively in 2018.\r\nFigure 58. Long Term Inequality Trend in Indonesia (Gini Ratio) Urban-Rural, 1976-2018 \r\nFurthermore, there are different trends for per capita expenditure of the top 20%, \r\nmiddle 60% and bottom 20% income groups (Figure 59). It is shown that from 2009 to \r\n2011, the top 20% has increased faster than the other income groups, widening the gap \r\n0.414\r\n0.384\r\n0.25\r\n0.27\r\n0.29\r\n0.31\r\n0.33\r\n0.35\r\n0.37\r\n0.39\r\n0.41\r\n0.43\r\nAFC GFC\r\n0.433\r\n0.391\r\n0.336\r\n0.319\r\n0.15\r\n0.2\r\n0.25\r\n0.3\r\n0.35\r\n0.4\r\n0.45\r\n1976\r\n1978\r\n1980\r\n1981\r\n1984\r\n1987\r\n1990\r\n1993\r\n1996\r\n1998\r\n1999\r\n2002\r\n2003\r\n2004\r\n2005\r\n2006\r\n2007\r\n2008\r\n2009\r\n2010\r\n2011\r\n2012\r\n2013\r\n2014\r\n2015\r\n2016\r\n2017\r\n2018\r\nGini Ratio for Urban-Rural\r\nUrban Rural\n\n113\r\nof inequality. Until 2018, the bottom 20% and the middle continue to grow significantly. \r\nThe period of 2015-2018 saw reduced inequality supported by increased consumption \r\ngrowth as well as faster distribution of the middle and bottom income groups compared \r\nto the top 20%. \r\nFigure 59. Trend of Expenditure per Capita, 2000-2018\r\nInequality can also be measured by Theil index that shows inequality between and \r\nwithin groups. Figure 60 shows the difference in the inequality of urban-rural areas. It is \r\nshown that after reaching its peak in 2011, inequality has been reduced from 2015 to \r\n2018. For a long time, the biggest contributor of national inequality is the intra-group \r\ninequality, which is within the urban areas and the rural areas itself. This is in line with \r\nthe national inequality framework which holds that regional inequality is more \r\ndependent on structural factors. Nevertheless, the urban-rural gap narrowed, and from \r\n2015 to 2018 showed significant decline. This phenomenon is attributed to the \r\ngovernment’s policy of “Developing from the periphery” and putting more attention in \r\nrural areas and villages through Village Fund (Dana Desa) and building infrastructure to \r\nachieve development convergence. Convergence means peripheral regions can catch up \r\nwith the more developed regions leading to a more equal distribution of wealth.\r\n0\r\n500\r\n1,000\r\n1,500\r\n2,000\r\n2,500\r\nAverage Expenditure per Capita (Constant 2012), in Thousands\r\nTop 20% Middle 60% Bottom 20%\n\n114\r\nFigure 60. Theil Index \r\nSome countries have shown that increased inequality is often an unavoidable \r\nproduct rapid economic growth. One example is Brazil. Having similar characteristics to \r\nIndonesia, Brazil experienced the fastest growth of inequality in South America. In Brazil’s \r\ncase, the success of tackling inequality is attributed to prudent management of macro￾economic stability including price stability, education expansion as well as massive pro￾poor social security expansion (World Bank, 2017). This shows that positive economic \r\ngrowth can be followed by a reduction in inequality. Therefore, improvements in \r\nstructural economic factors which determine the profile of the society in general, or \r\nspecifically the labor market, is key to the framework of any country’s inequality \r\nreduction policies.\r\nIn 2017 and 2018, DFI and OXFAM released The Commitment to Reducing \r\nInequality index, measured by indicators of policies implemented in a country, including \r\npolicies on public expenditures, taxes and employment. Table 4 shows Indonesia’s rank \r\nin terms of commitment to reducing inequality. In 2017, Indonesia ranked 101 out of 152 \r\ncountries, and later improved to 90 out of 157 countries in 2018. The increase in rank \r\nshows that Indonesia increased its commitment to reduce inequality. Indonesia is ranked \r\nbetter in the East Asia and Pacific region. Indonesia experienced improvements in public \r\nexpenditures and taxes. This was shown in this period by the increased budget allocation \r\nfor directly reducing inequality (redistribution including social assistance) and indirectly \r\n(building infrastructure). \r\nTable 4.

The increase for the middle class has an effect in reduced \r\ninequality in general. Figure 61 show the total of consumption growth from all households \r\nfrom 2014 to 2018, visualized with the Growth Incidence Curve (GIC). The figure shows \r\nthat, first, there is positive consumption growth across all households. Second, the welfare \r\nof the middle class increased higher than those of the poor and the rich. The rise of the \r\nmiddle class drives a more equal household consumption distribution or reducing \r\ninequality.\r\nFigure 61 Total National Consumption Growth\r\nFigure 62 shows the Growth Incidence Curve for urban-rural. There is similar \r\npattern for both urban and rural, in which the middle-class growth is higher, slightly \r\nhigher for rural areas than urban areas. Growth in rural areas is on average 25%, higher \r\nthan the urban areas of 16%. In urban areas, the 10th percentile to the 80th percentile \n\n116\r\nexperienced growth higher than average. In rural areas, the 40th percentile to the 90th\r\npercentile experienced growth higher than average. \r\nFigure 62 Total Consumption Growth for Urban-Rural \r\n2. National Poverty Rate and Percentage of the Poor Living in \r\nUnderdeveloped Regions\r\nIndonesia’s poverty rate was successfully reduced to 9.66% in 2018 despite slowing \r\ndown since 2012. However, there is a wide gap between the poverty rate of rural areas, \r\n13.1%, urban areas, 6.89%, although both experience declining rates. \r\nIn 2018, the percentage of the poor in rural areas decreased to 13.2% from 13.93% \r\nin 2017. This was supported by Special Allocated Funds (Dana Alokasi Khusus/DAK) \r\nvalued Rp14,9 trillion (2017) for 122 underdeveloped regions.\r\nFigure 63.

The poverty rate in underdeveloped regions \r\nare in decline following the decline of the national poverty rate albeit at a lower pace.\r\nFigure 64. Comparison of National Poverty Rate with Percentage of Poor in Underdeveloped \r\nRegions \r\nPoverty reduction targets are supported by policies that are also in line with targets \r\nof inclusive economic growth, including social security for the poor and vulnerable \r\nthrough the provision of universal health coverage (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional/JKN), \r\nand social assistance programs including the Hope Family Program (Program Keluarga \r\nHarapan/PKH), Smart Indonesia Program (Program Indonesia Pintar/PIP), and Rice for \r\nthe Poor (Beras Sejahtera/Rastra) as well as Non-Cash Food Assistance (Bantuan Pangan \r\nNon-Tunai/BPNT). In 2019, 80% of the Indonesian population has health insurance (JKN) \r\nand half of that are comprised of assistance beneficiaries (Penerima Bantuan Iuran/PBI) \r\nand targets of subsidies. In 2018, around 10 million households or 17% of the national \r\ntotal received the PKH social assistance, which targets families with pregnant women, \r\nschool children, elderly, and disabled members, in the form of conditional cash transfer. \r\nThis is a threefold increase from 2014. \r\nCurrent Policies, Efforts and Good Practices\r\nExpansion of National Health Insurance Members. In the effort to reduce \r\npoverty, Indonesia has implemented National Social Security System for health and for \r\nworkers. To implement it, the Social Security Organizing Body (Badan Penyelenggara \r\nJaminan Sosial/BPJS) is given the mandate to organize the social security programs. The \r\nprogram for health is the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional/JKN), \r\nwhich integrates hundreds of separate existing health insurance and employer-provided \r\nhealthcare services to its employees (self-insured). JKN pools contributions from three \r\ncategories of (i) the poor and near-poor as benefit beneficiaries from the government, (ii) \r\nthe employees in public and private formal sector, paid in percentage from both \r\nemployers and employees, and (iii) the non-poor working in the informal sector, which \r\nwill pay a fixed premium contribution. \r\nFigure 65 shows a significant increase in the JKN membership since 2014, and 81% \r\nof all population has had health insurance in May 2019. \r\n21.68 21.4 20.96 20.49\r\n11.22 10.86 10.64 9.82\r\n0\r\n5\r\n10\r\n15\r\n20\r\n25\r\n2015 2016 2017 2018\r\nPercentage of poor in\r\nunderdeveloped\r\nregions\r\nNational poverty rate\n\n118\r\nFigure 65.

Some of the dimensions of this index \r\ninclude availability and access of basic services, infrastructure, transportation, fulfilment \r\nof need for public services and governance. From these dimensions, villages are classified \r\ninto three categories: independent village, developing village and underdeveloped village. \r\nBox 24.\r\nBest Practices: SINERGI (Strengthening Coordination for Inclusive \r\nWorkforce Development in Indonesia)\r\nSupported by USAID, Rajawali Foundation together with the Center for Public Policy \r\nTransformation (Transformasi) and the Provincial Government of Central Java initiated this \r\nproject with the involvement of key stakeholders (government and private Sectors as well as \r\nyouth) to integrate women and youth with disabilities into the labour market in Central Java \r\nusing evidence-based policy options. Central Java was selected for the following reasons: (1) \r\nsome of its districts are living in poverty above the percentage of national average; (2) having \r\nthe second lowest provincial minimum wage rate in Indonesia, which encourages labour \r\nintensive industries; and (3) only half of its female population are working. This project aims to \r\nreduce inequality by promoting a more inclusive economic growth with greater focus on the \r\npoor and vulnerable youth.\r\nSINERGI has provided more than 5,000 youth with access to information, intervened in 445 poor \r\nand vulnerable youth, formed 21 youth-led associations for poor and vulnerable youth to access \r\ntraining, invited 18 local companies to provide apprenticeship programs, invited 15 trainers to \r\nprovide soft skill and technical training, and secured commitments from 106 provincial \r\ngovernments to support the project’s implementation until the end of its life cycle.\r\nData collection and regular updating remains a challenge that will require continuous \r\nimprovement. Sustainable financing is still under development, with plans on channeling Village \r\nFunds (Dana Desa) and Village-Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) to youth organizations. \n\n121\r\nFigure 68 shows the village development status for years 2014 and 2018. In 2014, \r\nIndonesia had 74,093 villages, in which 2,898 were independent villages, 50,763 were \r\ndeveloping villages, and 20,432 were underdeveloped villages. Between 2014 and 2018, \r\nIndonesia experienced division and merging of villages. Hence in 2018 Indonesia had \r\n75,436 villages, in which 5,606 were independent villages, 55,369 were developing \r\nvillages and 14,461 were underdeveloped villages. To be able to compare the data \r\nbetween the two years, adjustments are required to exclude the divisions and mergers of \r\nvillages in accordance with the 2014 data.\r\nFigure 68. Progress of Village Development, 2014 and 2018\r\nCurrent Policies, Efforts and Good Practices\r\nVillage Fund. Through Law No. 6 Year 2014 regarding Villages, the government was \r\ngiven a mandate to distribute the Village Fund to achieve the targets in the Medium Term \r\nNational Development Plan, especially increasing basic social services in villages; \r\nincreasing production, value added and income of the villagers; decreasing \r\nunemployment rates, poverty rates and stunting; strengthening village social cultural \r\ncapital; decreasing the number of underdeveloped villages; and increasing the number of \r\nindependent villages. In 2017, 74,957 villages have been assisted by 36,594 assistants in \r\nall regencies/cities, districts and villages; 18,446 village-owned enterprises (Badan Usaha \r\nMilik Desa/BUMDes) have been formed and strengthened to support village economic \r\nactivities; and Rp 58.95 trillion of Village Funds has been distributed to 434 \r\nregencies/cities (99% of the total of Village Funds of Rp60 trillion).\r\nWith the distribution of the Village Fund, it is apparent that the average economic \r\ngrowth of underdeveloped regions (Figure 69) have the same pattern as that of the \r\nnational economic growth, albeit with higher growth. Since 2012, after the commodity \r\nboom, Indonesia experienced economic contraction reflected in a slower rate of economic \r\ngrowth. However, Indonesia succeeds to maintain positive economic growth, and even \r\nhigher growth in underdeveloped regions. \r\nIndependent Villages Underdeveloped Villages Independent Villages Underdeveloped Villages\r\nDeveloping Villages\r\nDeveloping Villages\r\nNote: This comparison uses the number of villages in 2014, as much as 73.670\n\n122\r\nFigure 69. Average Economic Growth in Underdeveloped Regions \r\n4. Proportion of the Population Living Under 50% of Median Income \r\nAccording to the data available, this indicator may be measured through an \r\nexpenditures approach. This indicator is commonly used in developed countries to \r\nmeasure relative poverty. Although Indonesia has experienced decreasing absolute \r\npoverty rate, at the same time Indonesia experienced an increase in population living \r\nunder 50% of median expenditure as shown in Figure 70 below. The proportion has \r\ndecreased in 2018. This shows that although a percentage of the population is out of \r\nabsolute poverty but they are still vulnerable to poverty. Figure 70 also shows faster \r\nincrease in median expenditure of households in 2014-2018 in comparison to the average \r\nof expenditures below 50% median. The higher growth of the median also shows that the \r\nmiddle class is rising.\r\nFigure 70. Proportion of Population Living Below 50% of Median Income \r\nMeanwhile, Figure 71 shows the number of individuals living under 50% of median \r\nexpenditures according to gender and urban-rural area. Both males and females showed \r\nan increasing proportion of individuals living below the 50% of median income, with the \r\nfemale proportion being slightly higher than the male. The urban-rural gap is slightly \r\nmore significant. The proportion of population living below 50% median expenditures in \r\nrural areas are twice of those in urban areas. \r\n6.41 6.33 6.25\r\n5.89\r\n6.53\r\n5.46 5.31\r\n6.47\r\n4.5\r\n5\r\n5.5\r\n6\r\n6.5\r\n7\r\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\r\nAverage Economic Growth in Underdeveloped Regions \r\n(%)\r\n4.76 4.44\r\n5.36 5.27 5.84\r\n7.69\r\n8.68 8.98 8.81 8.18\r\n10.6910.09 9.51\r\n8.69 9.03\r\n10.17\r\n11.72\r\n12.8 12.63\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\n14\r\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\r\nProportion of Population Living Below 50% Median Income \r\n(Expenditure) (%) \n\n123\r\n \r\nFigure 71. Proportion of Population Living Below 50% of Median Income, by Gender and Urban￾Rural \r\nFigure 72 below shows the proportion of population living below 50% median \r\nexpenditures by disability status in 2018. Since 2018, the National Socio-Economic Survey \r\n(Susenas) has included questions on disability. There are eight (8) questions, including \r\ndifficulty in sight, hearing, walking or walking up the stairs, moving fingers, memorizing \r\nor concentrating, controlling behavior or emotion, speaking or communicating, and taking \r\ncare of oneself. The status of disability, as seen in the following figure, is defined as people \r\nexperiencing a little difficulty (moderate status) as well as a lot of difficulty and/or \r\nneeding assistance (severe status). From Figure 72, it is shown that the proportion of \r\npopulation living below 50% median expenditure are 2 percentage points higher for the \r\npeople with disability compared to people without disability. This may imply that \r\ndisabled individuals are relatively poorer compared to those without disability.\r\nFigure 72. Proportion of Population Living Below 50% of Median Income by Disability Status, 2018 \r\n5. Proportion of members of the National Social Security for Workers \r\nProgram\r\nOne of the efforts in reducing inequality and poverty is through the strengthening of \r\nsocial security systems especially for the poor and vulnerable through governance and \r\nsynchronization of the National Social Security System (Sistem Jaminan Sosial \r\n11.3612.05 12.44 12.31\r\n13.16 12.95\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\n14\r\n16\r\n18\r\n20\r\n2016 2017 2018\r\nMale Female\r\n7.92\r\n8.95 8.4\r\n15.74\r\n17.13 17.74\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\n14\r\n16\r\n18\r\n20\r\n2016 2017 2018\r\nUrban Rural\r\n14.17\r\n12.23\r\n8\r\n10\r\n12\r\n14\r\n16\r\nDisability Non-disability\r\nProportion of Population Living Below 50% of Median \r\nIncome by Disability Status\n\n124\r\nNasional/SJSN) for health and workers, as well as increasing the membership of universal \r\nhealth coverage (JKN) and workers insurance in the workplace. Law No 40 Year 2004 \r\nregarding the National Social Security System, the Social Security Organizing Body (Badan \r\nPenyelenggara Jaminan Sosial/BPJS) is given the mandate to organize social security \r\nprograms. For the workers, BPJS for workers provides several services, including \r\ninsurance for Work-Related Accidents (Program Jaminan Kecelakaan Kerja/JKK), Life \r\nInsurance (Jaminan Kematian/JKM), insurance for seniors (Jaminan Hari Tua/JHT), and \r\npension (Jaminan Pensiun). \r\nFigure 73 shows the membership of the social security for workers has increased \r\nsignificantly by more than two-folds since 2008. This trend is in line with the target of the \r\n2015-2019 National Medium Term Development Plan to cover as much as 62.4 million \r\nformal workers and 3.5 million informal workers in 2019. \r\nFrom the number of members, there are increases for wage workers, non-wage \r\nworkers and construction workers, as shown in Figure 73. Wage workers and \r\nconstruction workers as part of the formal sector have the biggest number of members. \r\nHowever non-wage workers or the informal sector has experienced the highest increase, \r\nthough the number is still relatively small. Although there is progress, more effort needs \r\nto be done because 75% of workers in Indonesia are not yet members of the social \r\nsecurity for workers, especially those in the informal sector, who are the bigger portion \r\nof workers in Indonesia. \r\nFigure 73. Proportion of Social Security for Workers Members and Membership of the Social \r\nSecurity for Workers\r\nB. Challenges\r\nThe challenges in development equality consists of two dimensions, a) inequality \r\nbetween income groups (including poverty reduction and social security for workers), \r\n11.48%\r\n16.79%\r\n24.56%\r\n0%\r\n5%\r\n10%\r\n15%\r\n20%\r\n25%\r\n30%\r\nProportion of Social Security for \r\nWorkers Membership\r\n0\r\n5\r\n10\r\n15\r\n20\r\n25\r\n30\r\n35\r\nNumber of Workers as Members \r\nof Social Security for Workers (in \r\nmillion)\r\nWage workers Non-wage workers\r\nConstructions\n\n125\r\nand b) regional inequality (including the acceleration of development of underdeveloped \r\nregions and villages). \r\nIn addressing inequality between income groups, the challenges include: (1) \r\nslowdown in poverty reduction; (2) unequal access and quality of health and nutrition \r\nservices; (3) unequal access and quality of education; (4) unequal access for households \r\nto housing and settlement; and (5) governance of unstandardized basic services. \r\nTherefore, a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder cooperation is required to reach the \r\npoor and vulnerable in the effort to reduce poverty.\r\nThe main challenges in addressing regional inequality include: (1) unequal \r\ndistribution of transportation and logistics networks, as well as national connectivity in \r\nsupporting leading sectors; (2) high cost of logistics and commodity prices in regions with \r\nlimited accessibility; (3) low accessibility to basic services and economic activity centers \r\nfor people living in villages, rural areas, underdeveloped regions, border regions and \r\ntransmigration regions; (4) disaster unpreparedness; and (5) inadequate facilities for \r\nfisheries logistics system.\r\nC. The Way Forward\r\nThe Government of Indonesia maintains a high and increasingly inclusive economic \r\ngrowth in order to serve all layers of society. Inclusive economic growth is centered upon \r\nupscaling and increasing economic access to reduce poverty and inequality through \r\nquality job creation. Policies to reduce inequality in 2019 Government Workplan and \r\nbeyond, focuses on the development of human and regional equality. \r\nReducing inequality between income groups is supported by several policies, \r\nincluding (1) acceleration of poverty reduction; (2) increasing access of community health \r\nand nutrition; (3) equal quality education; (4) increasing access to housing and \r\nsettlement; and (5) increasing governance of basic services. \r\nReducing regional inequality through connectivity and maritime development,\r\nthrough (1) an improved logistics system; (2) development of infrastructure; (3) \r\nacceleration of Papua and West Papua development; (4) acceleration of the development \r\nof underdeveloped regions and villages; and (5) disaster risk management. \n\n126\r\nBox 25.\r\nDesk Papua\r\nAcceleration of Welfare of Papua and West Papua\r\nRegional disparity remains a challenge in archipelagic Indonesia. In the effort to reduce regional \r\ninequality, Indonesia has committed to accelerate development on the two most eastern provinces of \r\nPapua and West Papua. Presidential Instruction No. 9 Year 2017 on Acceleration of Welfare Development \r\nin Papua and West Papua Provinces mandates related Ministries/Institutions and Papua and West Papua \r\nGovernment to work together in accelerating development in the two provinces through the \r\nestablishment of Desk Papua and all related Ministries/Institutions.\r\nIn the Ministry of National Development Planning, Desk Papua have been established and have \r\nformulated 2018-2019 National Action Plan (NAP) on the Presidential Instruction No. 9 Year 2017.

Yiwu has many permanent foreign residents and several “International\r\nCommunities” with a higher proportion of foreigners, which shows a feature of\r\nmulticultural integration.\r\n4.2.2 Overall Progress\r\nYiwu’s urban development are set to undergo five stages: a small town, a small\r\ncity, a medium-sized city, a big city, and an urban-rural integrated city, of which a big\r\ncity with the integration of rural and urban areas is Yiwu’s ultimate goal.\r\nSmart city\r\nYiwu platform of Zhejiang Government Affairs Service Network\r\n45 1872 100%\r\nunits joined declarable items administrative examination and approval\r\nitems into the government service network\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n37\r\nA panoramic view of Yiwu’s main urban area\r\n4.2.3 Specific Measures\r\n(1) Promoting sustainable urban development through urban\r\nrenewal\r\nThe urban built-up area has reached 109.4 square kilometers in 2020 from 5.06\r\nsquare kilometers in 1990 with the resident population growing to 1.86 million from\r\naround 700,000. With the rapid economic growth, the old urban area, where Yiwu’s\r\ntrade and commerce originated, was long unable to meet the needs of building an\r\ninternational city and was faced with problems like aging facilities and outdated\r\nindustrial structure. To improve urban functions, living environment and public\r\nservice facilities, Yiwu started the urban renewal work with the requisition and\r\nrenovation of old downtown areas as the core in 2016. Following the principles of\r\nretaining Yiwu’s historical and cultural features and respecting the inherent laws and\r\nregularities required in urban development, this renewal work has defined three types\r\nof zones, to be demolished for reconstruction, to be renovated for new function, and\r\nto remain unchanged, so as to embark on an effective and sustainable urban\r\ndevelopment path.\n\nUN SDGs\r\n38\r\nThrough a variety of transforming and upgrading approaches such as facade\r\nrefurbishment along the streets, protection and tourism development of neighborhoods\r\nwith historical and cultural values, house renovation of old neighborhoods, and\r\nreconstruction of old factories, the Yiwu government has systematically carried out\r\nthe renewal of urban areas with rational placement of residents, optimum protection\r\nof historical relics, and humanistic care of people.\r\nYiwu New Community Construction\r\nIntroducing reasonable expropriation and compensation policies\r\nThe first round of urban renewal in Yiwu mainly targeted at the old and\r\ndilapidated residential areas, which occupied a superior geographical location but had\r\nmany problems including scattered layout, inefficiency in land use and obsolescence\r\nof facilities. However, most residents were elderly with low economic affordability\r\nand unwillingness to leave the place where they had lived for a long time. This made\r\nthe land expropriation more difficult. Faced with this situation in which traditional\r\nway of physical compensation with land or other premises was no longer practical and\r\nsustainable, the government issued a series of expropriation policies and adopted the\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n39\r\ncompensation approach of “Equivalent Value Compensation plus a Certain Proportion\r\nof Subsidies and Incentives”, offering expropriated owners options of currency,\r\nproperty right exchange and monetary resettlement vouchers. By the year 2020,\r\nrenewal work has been in full swing in those old urban areas and 12 old blocks were\r\nexpropriated with a total construction area of about 3 million m2\r\n.\r\nBuilding a habitable urban “Future Community”\r\nThe renewal in the old residential areas is not just demolishing all and rebuilding\r\nall at one stroke, but a process of step-by-step transformation involving function\r\nupgrading and area-to-area reconstruction after demolition. In addition to the\r\ndevelopment of replacement housing and commercial housing, the construction of\r\npublic utilities and infrastructure supporting projects is also advancing simultaneously,\r\nsuch as school building, renovation and expansion, community neighborhood center\r\nconstruction, and municipal road network optimization. The resettlement houses are\r\nlocated in modern communities with beautiful environment, and the old residential\r\nareas in the old town have turned into intensive, high-quality modern communities.\r\nThe Xiachemen community was included as one of the first “Future\r\nCommunity” construction pilot projects in Zhejiang Province in 2019. Focusing on\r\npeople-centered, green and digital progress, the “Future Community” features\r\nharmonious relationships, green development, and smart and connected facilities,\r\nbringing high-quality life to the residents. The “Future Community” aims to build up\r\na system integrated various functions such as human connections, education, medical\r\ncare, entrepreneurship, construction, transportation, low-carbon development, services,\r\nand governance so as to create future urban residential providing senses of belonging\r\nand comfort, thus promoting people’s overall development and social progress.\r\nStrengthening preservation and utilization of old buildings in renewal and\r\nrenovation\n\nUN SDGs\r\n40\r\nThe old industrial zone and the old market in the city center enjoys a good\r\nlocation with a rich accumulation of local history and culture. At the same time, the\r\nbuildings in these areas had a very spacious interior, suitable to be transformed for\r\ndeveloping various cultural and creative industries. The place that used to sit the\r\nrailway station was designated for a renovation project of a cultural and creative park.\r\nThe renovation follows the rule of repairing and restoring, making full use of the\r\noriginal factories, warehouses, staff dormitories, etc. While maintaining the original\r\nstructural system and spatial relations, the old factory buildings’ exterior and interior\r\nspaces were redesigned and renovated with many industrial elements. It was then\r\ntransformed into the Old Railway Station-1970 Cultural and Creative Park, the first\r\ncultural block integrated with fashion, creativity, life and aesthetics in Yiwu, with its\r\nname in honor of these buildings dated back to 1970s. Another example is “Binwang\r\n158 Cultural and Creative Park” transformed from the Binwang market.\r\nAttaching great importance to community capacity to withstand disasters\r\nYiwu has vigorously promoted disaster shelters’ construction since 2007. In\r\naccordance with the principle of “dispersed resettlement as the priority and\r\ncentralized resettlement as a supplement while seeking shelters nearby at residents’\r\nconvenience”, by making full use of urban and rural schools, cultural auditoriums,\r\nhome care centers for the elderly and nursing homes, Yiwu now has 409 disaster\r\nshelters citywide with a total area of 112, 500 m2 and a full range of services,\r\nsufficient for up to 50, 000 disaster victims with different needs. Outside all the\r\ndisaster shelters, signs are set up to let people, upon the occurrence of a disaster, know\r\nwhere to transfer. Inside all the disaster shelters, functional divisions, including men’s\r\nand women’s lounges, offices, toilets, canteens and kitchens, etc. can effectively\r\nguarantee the basic livelihood of the disaster-afflicted people.\r\nMeanwhile, the disaster relief supplies reserve system is optimized. Besides the\r\ndisaster relief supplies reserve in the city, proper, independent warehouses of disaster\r\nrelief supplies are also set up near the disaster shelters in towns, districts, and villages\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n41\r\n(communities), with more than 10,000 pieces of relief materials, including camp beds,\r\ncotton clothes and quilts, straw mats, emergency lights, rain gear, daily necessities, etc.\r\nreserved in a total storage area of nearly 6,000 m2. Yiwu has also established a\r\ndisaster relief materials security system that combines earmarked physical storage\r\nwith agreement-based reserves.\r\nYiwu Diaoyuji Park\r\n(2) Building a harmonious international community\r\nYiwu is home to more than 15,000 resident foreigners from more than 100\r\ncountries and regions, making it one of the cities in China with the highest density of\r\nforeigners. A number of international communities have been formed in Yiwu with\r\nChinese and foreign residents harmoniously living together. The Jimingshan\r\ncommunity and the Jincheng Golf community are the most typical of them, with over\r\n1,000 foreign residents.\r\nProviding language-skills-improving services for community foreigners\n\nUN SDGs\r\n42\r\nFor resident foreigners in Yiwu, one of the most prominent barriers in daily life\r\nis communication in Chinese. To solve this problem, the Jimingshan community has\r\nestablished Tongyue Social Work Service Center which provides Chinese language\r\ncourses for them. The courses are open from Monday to Friday with teachers from\r\ncolleges. Besides Chinese language learning, there are also legal lectures, foreign\r\nlanguage salons, etc., helping them improve Chinese proficiency, do business more\r\nsmoothly, communicate more fluently with Chinese people, and better integrate into\r\nYiwu.\r\nCarrying out various community cross-cultural activities\r\nInternational communities hold rich cultural activities for foreign and local\r\nresidents. Regular activities include “Chinese and Foreign Neighbors’ Day”, “Our\r\nFestival, and “Charity Fair”. During traditional Chinese festivals, local residents in\r\ninternational communities will invite foreign friends to their homes to make Jiaozi，\r\nwrap Zongzi, hang up Spring Festival couplets, and have family reunion dinners, and\r\nexplain the cultural implications to them. In this way, foreigners can better feel the\r\ncharm of Chinese culture and reduce their sense of loneliness. These informal\r\nactivities help foreigners learn about Yiwu’s customs and lifestyles, playing an\r\nimportant role in promoting community integration.\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n43\r\nForeigners are spending Chinese Spring Festival with local residents\r\nEncouraging foreigners’ participation in community management\r\nIt is appreciated that foreign residents participate in community management in\r\ncommunities with large numbers of foreigners. In the Jimingshan community, foreign\r\nresidents voluntarily join various community service teams guaranteeing the safety\r\nand harmony in the community. In the Jincheng Golf community, many foreign\r\nresidents have become community mediators to resolve disputes and contradictions\r\nbetween Chinese and foreign residents. Participation in community management\r\nmakes foreigners feel being an integral part of the community and enhances their\r\nsense of identity and belonging.\n\nUN SDGs\r\n44\r\nYiwu Jimingshan Community Service Center\r\n(3) Building urban “Green Lungs” to improve life quality\r\nFocusing on air and water quality governance\r\nIn recent years, Yiwu has focused on 10 special campaigns, such as overall dust\r\ncontrol, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs for short) pollution control, and motor\r\nvehicle pollution prevention and control, following the principle of all-element\r\nimprovement, whole-process supervision and all-field breakthroughs. In 2019, Yiwu\r\npioneered the intelligent supervision of the operation of VOCs exhaust treatment\r\nfacilities and realized full coverage of the exhaust emission monitoring enterprises\r\nwith annual emissions of over 10 tons of VOCs. At present, Yiwu has built up a\r\ncity-wide atmospheric monitoring and perception network, a visual data integration\r\nanalysis platform running around the clock, and a whole-process collaborated disposal\r\ncenter, so as to achieve the closed-loop management of problems, i.e. the loop of\r\n“discovery, assignment, disposal, and feedback”. In 2020, Yiwu Air Quality Index\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n45\r\n(AQI for short) good rate was 98.7%, which means its air quality was good for 98.7%\r\ntime of the year.; the average concentration of PM2.5 was 24 ug/m3; and the air\r\nquality reached the national class II standard.\r\nIn terms of water treatment, Yiwu adheres to source governance and whole area\r\ngovernance. More than 4 billion yuan has been invested to build 9 sewage treatment\r\nplants (with a daily processing capacity of 540,000 tons) with 2,470 kms of\r\nsupporting sewage main pipes and capillary pipe network extending for as long as\r\n100,000 kms. Direct sewage discharge has been eliminated in 366 blocks across the\r\ncity as the city aims to promote mixed management of rainwater and sewage mixture\r\nand to strengthen centralized treatment of sewage with more decontamination pipes.\r\nThrough unremitting efforts, the water quality of all 7 centralized drinking water\r\nsources has reached or exceeded Class II, and the water quality of 8 cross-section\r\nmonitoring points controlled at municipal level or above has reached a qualified rate\r\nof 100%.\r\nAir quality from 2016 to 2020 in Yiwu\r\nCarrying out effective land environment governance\r\nTo thoroughly implement Yiwu Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Plan, the\r\ngovernment has established a system which specifies responsibility for each\n\nUN SDGs\r\n46\r\ndepartment to prevent and control soil pollution and formulated a reward system for\r\nreporting environmental violations of solid waste so as to promote the progress of a\r\n“Waste-free City”. In order to speed up the buildup of solid waste disposal capacity to\r\nmatch the international first-class standards, Yiwu has invested 1.6 billion yuan to\r\nbuild a waste incineration plant with a daily processing capacity of 3, 000 tons,\r\nrealizing zero landfills and 100% harmless disposal of urban household waste. Yiwu\r\nhas invested 230 million yuan in a food waste disposal project and 590 million yuan\r\nin a sludge drying and incineration project with a sludge disposal capacity of 750 tons\r\nper day.\r\nThe Yiwu River under the blue sky\r\nSpeeding up the establishment of “Green Lungs in Urban Center”\r\nYiwu was awarded the titles of “National Garden City” and “National Forest\r\nCity” in 2008 and 2015. The forest coverage ratio has reached 50.89%, with 4,061\r\nhectares of urban green area and 13.19 m2 of park green area per capita, and the green\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n47\r\narea ratio in the built-up area was 37.04%. A series of urban parks, represented by\r\nRiverside Green Corridor, Xiuhu Square, Xiuhu Park and Futian Wetland Park, have\r\nbeen built.\r\nAt the end of 2018, the city set a clear goal to build up a wetland ecological park\r\nwith the total area of 8.4 km2 as a green lung area in order to integrate the outskirts of\r\nthe city into the inside. forming a channel for conveying fresh air from the suburbs to\r\nthe urban hinterland. The area is rich in vegetation and complete in water system. On\r\nthe basis of conserving vegetation, water system and terrain features, Yiwu sorted out\r\nthe existing available farms, seedlings, buildings and roads to form a natural,\r\nfree-styled, and multi-cellular ring network planning structure, and created the largest\r\ncomprehensive urban botanical garden in east China, with the main features of sports\r\nfitness, ecological experience, and cultural recreation.\r\nYiwu Botanical Garden\r\n(4) Building an integrated transportation system\r\nUp till now, an integrated transportation system with coordinated development of\n\nUN SDGs\r\n48\r\nmultiple transportation such as roads, railways, and aviation has been initially taken\r\nshape in Yiwu, with a logistics network connecting 321 cities across the country with\r\nthe world, making Yiwu a major inland port in Zhejiang Province and the largest\r\nless-than-carload cargo stowage center in China. For that reason, Yiwu has been listed\r\nas an international inland port city by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for\r\nAsia and the Pacific. Yiwu has increased investments in transportation expansion to\r\npromote development, and formed an integrated transportation system with the\r\ncoordinated development of multiple transportation modes, such as roads, railways\r\nand aviation, which has all contributed to the initial establishment of the status of a\r\nnational integrated transportation hub, sustained and rapid economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and building the World’s “Capital of Small Commodities”.\r\nStrengthening connection with the world by means of convenient aviation\r\nnetwork\r\nYiwu Airport is the largest airport in the central and western regions of Zhejiang\r\nProvince. So far, Yiwu Airport has opened flights to 21 domestic cities, including\r\nBeijing, and 6 overseas cities (regions), including Bangkok. In 2019, the passenger\r\nthroughput was 2.029 million, ranking fourth in Zhejiang Province and 73rd in China.\r\nIn December 2016, the airport successfully launched the cargo service in the belly\r\ncompartment of international (regional) flights and achieved a breakthrough in the air\r\ncargo transportation. The opening of the cargo flight route has played a positive role\r\nin China (Yiwu) Cross-border E-commerce Integrated Pilot Zone and the Integrated\r\nPilot Zone of International Trade Reform. In 2020, the opening of the international\r\ncargo and mail routes for Japanese inbound mails made Yiwu Airport the first\r\ncounty-level air port to provide overseas inbound mail services in China.\r\nBoosting urban development by means of convenient railway transportation\r\nnetwork\r\nIn 2019, Yiwu Railway Station received a passenger flow of over 25 million,\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n49\r\nwith an average daily passenger flow of over 70,000, and about 100,000 during peak\r\nperiods. The high-speed rail has made it faster to travel from Yiwu to China’s\r\nmetropolises. It takes only one and half hours to Shanghai and 6 hours and 50 minutes\r\nto Guangzhou or Beijing. The Yiwu section of Ningbo-Jinhua Railway, which got off\r\nthe ground in August 2019, will connect Yiwu to Ningbo Zhoushan Port, the largest\r\nport in the world, and will bring great convenience to the import and export trade of\r\nYiwu after its completion.\r\nIn the aspect of international railway, the “Yiwu-Xinjiang-Europe” railway\r\nconstruction has achieved remarkable results. Since its first launch in November 2014,\r\nthe “Yiwu-Xinjiang-Europe” Railway Express has opened 11 routes, connecting 37\r\ncountries and regions in the Eurasian continent, and become the China-Europe\r\nRailway Express covering the longest route with highest full-load rate and highest\r\nnumber of countries connected.\r\n“Yiwu on the Track” is also reflected in the integrated and commuting-efficient\r\nurban rail transit network. The rail transit routes in Yiwu can be divided into three\r\nfunctional structures, including intercity railway, the Jinhua express line, and the\r\nYiwu rail line. Among them, the intercity railway connects Yiwu with the Yangtze\r\nRiver Delta and the central cities of Zhejiang Province; the urban express line, relying\r\non the construction of the central Zhejiang city cluster, establishes a commuting circle\r\nof 30 minutes to 1 hour between Yiwu and the urban centers of Jinhua, Dongyang,\r\nPujiang and other places; Yiwu’s urban rail plays the role of connecting the main and\r\nsub-urban areas and serving as the transportation hubs so as to achieve the goal of\r\nreaching the city center within half an hour from any main clusters in Yiwu.\r\nBoosting urban economic development by means of convenient highway network\r\nWith constantly strengthening the construction of the internal and external\r\nnetwork of highways, Yiwu has become the first county-level city to build a beltway\r\nwith the most expressway exits and also the first county-level city to realize toll-free\n\nUN SDGs\r\n50\r\npolicy for national passenger cars in the domestic expressways in China. By the end\r\nof 2020, the total length of highways in the city is about 1,559 kilometers, of which\r\nthe expressways’ length is 76 kilometers, and the highway network area density is\r\n141.09 km/100 km2, forming a grand pattern of urban development based on the\r\ntransportation development.\r\n(5) Building a smart city\r\nThe construction of the smart city in Yiwu can be explained by the conceptual\r\nmodel of “158”. “1” stands for the construction of ONE smart city operation and\r\nmanagement center. “5” represents the overall advancement of the smart city in FIVE\r\nmajor areas, i.e. smart government, smart shopping, smart governance, smart culture\r\nand smart ecology. And “8” means the accomplishment of EIGHT major tasks,\r\nnamely smart infrastructure, universal access to data dividends, efficient government\r\nmanagement, convenient public services, refined social governance, modernized\r\nindustrial development, livable ecological environment, and high-quality cultural\r\nprogress.\r\nAchieving 5G coverage before the construction of the smart city\r\n5G enables more devices of the Internet of Things (IoT for short) to be connected\r\nto the network. The IoT is the foundation of the development of smart cities, so 5G is\r\na new key type of infrastructure to build smart cities. In October 2018, the Yiwu\r\nBranch of China Mobile completed the first 5G demonstration station in Jinhua City.\r\nIn 2020, Yiwu achieved full coverage of 5G signals in the urban area and formed a\r\nbatch of 5G application demonstration pilots in key industries, such as E-Commerce\r\nand logistics. In 2021, Yiwu will push forward the extension of 5G networks to rural\r\nareas, basically achieving full coverage of towns, districts and administrative villages,\r\nand the number of 5G macro stations will reach 3,000.\r\nEstablishing a smart city plan oriented to the needs of citizens\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n51\r\nAt the beginning of 2015, the municipal government analyzed in detail the needs\r\nand suggestions of the general public on smart city construction through a public\r\nopinion survey, and determined that smart transportation, smart medical care, smart\r\necology, and smart administrative services would be current main tasks and for the\r\nnext year or two.\r\n(1) Smart transportation. Yiwu Smart Traffic Information System monitors\r\nimportant road sections and stations in the city around the clock, supervises various\r\nkinds of necessary traffic information in real time, and releases them through\r\nplatforms, such as variable electronic information boards, radio stations, websites,\r\nmobile phone SMS and so on. Motor vehicle drivers can plan the best route based on\r\ntraffic information released. The monitoring system can also automatically capture\r\nillegal parking, making it easier for traffic control departments to detect and deal with\r\ntraffic accidents in a timely manner, which greatly helps reduce various factors that\r\nmay cause congestion. Meanwhile, Yiwu urban area has already realized the\r\ninternet-connected control of all signal control intersections and full coverage of\r\nvideo detection system, which has improved the control efficiency of urban signals\r\nand reduced the number of parking times and travel delays, helping citizens reduce\r\nthe average commuting time by more than 10%.\r\n(2) Smart medical care. In August 2018, Yiwu established a cloud platform of\r\n“Smart Health”, which carries the daily registration and settlement business of 14\r\ntownship health centers and collects relevant information from many public medical\r\nunits and large hospitals. The platform breaks the dispersal of medical data under the\r\ntraditional model and realizes the functions of medical resource sharing, online\r\ndiagnosis, remote monitoring, and interactive control. Meanwhile, the pilot program\r\nof electronic certificates and licenses has been implemented; 32 key application\r\nscenarios, such as electronic ID cards and medical insurance cards, have been\r\npromoted; and electronic social insurance cards and health insurance cards have been\r\nfully covered in 18 public hospitals and 252 pharmacies in the city.\n\nUN SDGs\r\n52\r\n(3) Smart ecology. Yiwu has now built such infrastructural facilities as automatic\r\nair stations, automatic surface water monitoring stations, automatic drinking water\r\nmonitoring stations and noise monitoring stations, to monitor environmental data in\r\nreal time. These data will be integrated through the Internet and finally aggregated\r\ninto a large data, which provides reference for environmental law enforcement. The\r\nsmart ecosystem allows citizens to be informed of the current temperature, air quality,\r\nenvironmental warnings and other information at any time through various channels,\r\nsuch as WeChat, websites, and LED screens. When citizens find environmental\r\npollution problems, they can also file complaints in time through WeChat, telephone,\r\netc.\r\n(4) Smart administrative services. In 2018, the Yiwu platform of Zhejiang\r\nGovernment Affairs Service Network was launched. It is an online government affairs\r\nservice system that integrates consultation, inquiry, appointment, handling and other\r\nwhole-process services. 45 units have stationed on the platform, where 1,872 items\r\ncan be declared online, of which 307 items are for administrative examination and\r\napproval, accounting for 100% of this kind. This platform has greatly facilitated\r\nonline direct application and processing or material pre-review and effectively\r\nimproved the work efficiency. In accordance with the requirements of “Five Zeros” on\r\nsmart handling of service items in seconds (namely “zero applications in paper”,\r\n“zero form to fill in”, “zero manual examinations and approvals”, “zero in-person\r\ncollection of licenses” and “zero paper archives”), the city has realized 54 items\r\n“handled in seconds”, 105 items with both zero paper application materials and zero\r\nform to fill in, 271 items with zero paper application materials, 177 items with zero\r\nforms to fill in, and 244 items “approved in seconds”, reaching an online completion\r\nrate of 92%.\r\nYiwu has also continuously strengthened the promotion of smart city projects,\r\nsuch as smart parking, smart elderly care, and smart fire prevention, so as to make the\r\nurban operation more efficient.\n\nYiwu Voluntary Local Review\r\n53\r\nYiwu Senshan Dendrobium-officinale Geographic Park",

In the past two decades, Israel’s population increased from 6 \r\nmillion people in 1998 to 9 million in 2018.\n\n197\r\nGOAL 11\r\nAccording to demographic predictions, Israel’s \r\npopulation will reach 11 million by 2030 and 15 \r\nmillion by 2048 (Israel’s centennial). Israel is also \r\none of the world’s most densely populated and \r\nurbanized countries, with approximately 93% of its \r\npopulation living in cities. These facts illustrate the \r\nimportance of promoting better urbanism in Israel \r\nand strengthening the sustainability, resilience \r\nand inclusiveness of cities and regions throughout \r\nthe country. \r\nThese challenges are addressed by the Ministry of \r\nConstruction and Housing (MOCH), by the Israel \r\nPlanning Administration (IPA) and by the Ministry \r\nof the Interior. The MOCH leads the processes \r\nof policy planning and implementation in the \r\nfield of urbanism, urban planning and urban \r\ndevelopment as well as in the areas of public and \r\nsocial housing, affordable housing, development \r\nof new construction methods and the assimilation \r\nof advanced technology and innovation in the \r\nconstruction industry. The IPA formulates national \r\nplanning policy on various issues and initiates \r\nnational, regional and local master plans, strategic \r\nplans and policy and procedural guidelines, with \r\nthe aim to increase the efficient use of land and \r\nto improve the compactness and livability of all \r\nenvironments. The Ministry of the Interior leads the \r\nnational policy and strategy for local government, \r\nwith the aim to increase economic growth, to narrow \r\ngaps between communities and to strengthen \r\nnational and regional planning. \r\nUrban renewal, in all its facets, is a cornerstone \r\nobjective of Israel’s government and one of the \r\nmain challenges in the country. In light of the rate \r\nof population increase and the shortage in land \r\nresources, the government recognized the need \r\nfor urgent and creative solutions to intensify and \r\nconcentrate population densities in the cities and \r\nis placing a great emphasis in this area. In August \r\n2016, the Law for a Government Authority for Urban \r\nRenewal was approved, establishing a designated \r\nbody responsible for urban renewal in Israel. In \r\nlight of the seminal role played by urban renewal \r\nin sustainable cities both in Israel and globally, the \r\nMOCH, as the leading ministry in Israel on promoting \r\nSDG 11, is considering the proposal of a new local \r\nindicator for urban renewal which could provide the \r\nbasis for a global indicator within SDG 11.\r\nAffordable housing and basic \r\nservices (SDG 11.1)\r\nOne of the main challenges facing the State of Israel \r\nis to ensure affordable housing for its citizens. \r\nApproximately 70% of apartments in Israel are \r\nprivately-owned and homeownership is still an \r\naspired goal for many citizens. \r\nFigure 11.1\r\nApartment purchase and rental prices to net income ratios\r\n Apartment purchase price to net income ratio\r\nFigure 11.1\r\nRent to net income ratio\r\n8.6 \r\n6.7 \r\n7.1 \r\n5.5 \r\n7.4 \r\n6.8 \r\n7.9 \r\n7.4 \r\n0.34 \r\n0.29 \r\n0.32 \r\n0.24 \r\n0.26 0.25 \r\n0.23 \r\n0.15\r\n0.17\r\n0.19\r\n0.21\r\n0.23\r\n0.25\r\n0.27\r\n0.29\r\n0.31\r\n0.33\r\n0.35\r\n4.0\r\n4.5\r\n5.0\r\n5.5\r\n6.0\r\n6.5\r\n7.0\r\n7.5\r\n8.0\r\n8.5\r\n9.0\r\nYears of income\r\nPercentage of household \r\nincome paid to rent\r\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017* 2018*\r\nHigh Affordability Low Affordability\r\nAverage income for 2017-2018: estimated by the Economic Analysis Division, MOCH\r\n*Rent prices are adjusted to the apartment prices index, base year 2015.\n\n198\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nDuring the last decade, real housing prices have \r\nalmost doubled due, inter alia, to rapid population \r\ngrowth, low unemployment rates, growth in family \r\nincome and low interest rates – all of which have \r\ncaused housing demand to increase while supply \r\nhas remained relatively low. At the same time, \r\nrental prices have increased at a much lower \r\nrate. In fact, affordable housing, in terms of rental \r\nhousing, remained stable throughout the years \r\n(purchase and rental prices relative to income, \r\nFigure 11.1). \r\nAs part of the effort to increase the housing supply, \r\nthe Israeli government approved a new holistic \r\nNational Strategic Housing Plan in February 2017. \r\nThe plan determines the future housing needs of \r\nthe population: 1.5 million new residential units \r\nby the year 2040. In order to reach this target and \r\ndue to the gap between the number of approved \r\nunits and number of actualized units, a target of \r\n2.6 million planned residential units was set.\r\nTo assess progress toward meeting the intermediate \r\nobjectives of the strategic housing plan and the \r\nplanning objectives, a locally suggested indicator \r\nis proposed (Figure 11.2). \r\nCurrently, subsidized apartment-purchase tracks \r\nare offered to the public, as in the example of ‘Mehir \r\nFigure 11.2\r\nApproved housing units\r\nFigure 11.2\r\n118,000\r\n112,000\r\n104,000\r\n104,000\r\n104,000\r\n127,163\r\n110,920\r\n99,537\r\n62,199\r\n73,610\r\n0 30,000 60,000 90,000 120,000 150,000\r\n*2036-2040\r\n*2031-2035\r\n*2026-2030\r\n*2021-2025\r\n*2017-2020\r\n2017\r\n2016\r\n2015\r\n2014\r\n2013\r\nPer Year*\r\nCASE STUDY\r\nNeighborhood 360°\r\nNeighborhood 360° is an innovative measuring tool that aims to promote the planning, development \r\nand building of quality, healthy, prosperous and sustainable neighborhoods in Israel. The tool \r\nintegrates multi-dimensional development indexes by setting estimation criteria and standards for \r\nthe quality of the planning process, by incorporating environmental considerations in the planning \r\nand execution stages, and by promoting vibrant urban neighborhoods. The tool is adapted to the \r\ndevelopment patterns and the planning reality in Israel and will serve professionals from the early \r\nplanning stages, through the development and building stages, and ending with the populating stage. \r\nThe assessment of a project using the tool includes an examination and analysis of approximately \r\n50 sustainability criteria in infrastructure and building, natural and public spaces, and efficient \r\nresource use. For each of these parameters, a unique index was developed, specifically adapted \r\nto the reality in Israel, and a weighted scoring scale was defined.\n\n199\r\nGOAL 11\r\nLamishtaken’ (Buyer’s Price), in which first-time \r\napartment buyers are given a significant discount \r\noff the market price. In addition, in order to improve \r\ncompatibility between planning and housing needs, \r\nthe government established the Housing Cabinet, \r\nwhich serves as a coordinator between the relevant \r\nbodies. For populations unable to afford housing, \r\nseveral housing assistance programs are offered, \r\ndesignated for a variety of populations of different \r\nsocioeconomic backgrounds, such as public \r\nhousing allocations and rent assistance to eligible \r\npeople (Figure 11.3).\r\nWhen it comes to neighborhood planning, a diverse \r\narray of actions exists, such as: land siting surveys, \r\nfeasibility studies, theoretical plans and urban \r\nbuilding schemes. In this field, the government \r\nis promoting planning excellence, knowledge \r\ndissemination and the publication of guides on \r\ndifferent subjects, such as the “Neighborhood \r\n360°” guide (see box). \r\nTo ensure the quality of apartment and building \r\nconstruction, building and sustainable building codes \r\nare being prepared. Building codes will include all \r\nbuilding guidelines and regulations, enabling Israel \r\nto meet international standards in various areas: \r\nacoustics, fire safety, damp and moisture protection, \r\nbuilding energy scoring, waste collection, venting \r\nand acclimation, and more. Sustainable building \r\ncodes will relate to areas such as shading, energy \r\nefficiency, green construction and parking allocations \r\n(which were reduced in correlation with the building’s \r\nproximity to mass transit). \r\nUrban renewal in Israel\r\nThe Israeli housing market is characterized by a \r\nhigh proportion of homeownership, which poses \r\na difficulty for urban renewal projects. Israel’s \r\ngovernments have created a number of tracks to \r\nencourage and implement urban renewal, with \r\nthe emphasis on increasing building rights in \r\nreturn for upgrading the resilience of buildings to \r\nearthquakes by strengthening or reconstructing \r\nexisting buildings. In most tracks, the renewal of \r\npublic spaces is also addressed. \r\nAmong its many benefits, urban renewal leads to \r\nquality densification and thus to better, rejuvenated \r\ncities. Furthermore, Israel is located in a seismic￾sensitive area, with a probable risk of earthquakes. \r\nSince past building standards did not comply with \r\nthe national standard for structural durability in an \r\nearthquake, Israel’s Urban Renewal National Master \r\nPlan requires the strengthening of existing buildings \r\nas a prerequisite for the addition of building rights. \r\nIsrael’s Strategic Housing Plan for 2040 sets \r\ntargets for the number of housing units to be built \r\nFigure 11.3\r\nHousing assistance over the last decade\r\nFigure 11.3\r\n136.5 137.7 138.4 138.3 139.2 142.8 146.1 149.6 162.7 168.4 171.2\r\n348.7 341.9 348.2 350.1 351.4\r\n406.5 414.7 424.3\r\n467.4\r\n499.7\r\n534.5\r\n0.0\r\n100.0\r\n200.0\r\n300.0\r\n400.0\r\n500.0\r\n600.0\r\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\r\nNumber of eligible for rent assistance (thousands)\r\nCost of rent assistance (in thousands, USD)\r\nthousands USD\n\n200\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nin urban renewal projects until target year 2030. \r\nAccording to the plan, 20% of the additional, plan￾approved housing units are to be built by 2020 and \r\nup to 35% by target year 2030. This target includes \r\nunbuilt plots in urban areas that are not under the \r\nAuthority’s jurisdiction. In light of the multiplicity \r\nof parameters for measurement, efforts are \r\nconcentrating on coordinating the data in order to \r\nascertain whether the target is met or not.\r\nIn the local context, due to the expected increase \r\nin plan approvals in 2018-2020, the Urban Renewal \r\nAuthority expects to achieve the objective for 2017-\r\n2020: building 21,000 housing units in the urban \r\nrenewal track in 2020 (20% of total plans approved) \r\nas part of meeting the final target for 2030 – building \r\n870,000 housing units, representing a third of the \r\ntotal approved housing units. In order to measure \r\nprogress toward meeting the target of the Strategic \r\nCASE STUDY\r\nThe “Kiryat Moshe” Project in the City of Rehovot\r\nThis project is a detailed plan for urban renewal, as part of the government decision to promote \r\nurban renewal and regeneration in neighborhoods with a majority of Jews of Ethiopian descent. \r\nAccording to this plan, old buildings will be destroyed, and new residential buildings will \r\nbe constructed in their stead. The plan makes use of available land near the neighborhood \r\n(called “complementary land”). \r\nToday there are 1,629 apartments in the neighborhood. The plan allows for the building of \r\n8,000 additional housing units, thereby transforming the neighborhood into a large, central \r\nblock of the city. Today, approximately 7,000 residents live in the neighborhood, with 30,000 \r\nresidents expected to reside in the neighborhood in the future. The plan includes an addition \r\nof public buildings and open spaces on approximately 0.4 km2\r\n. As part of the renewal \r\nprogram, a set of assistance tools was provided to the residents, such as the establishment \r\nof a community administrative authority, funding for fully executing resident’s rights, and \r\nsocial care and assistance.\r\nSimulation: Barre Levie Dayan Architects\n\n201\r\nGOAL 11\r\nHousing Plan for 2040, a locally relevant indicator \r\nis proposed: percentage of housing units in urban \r\nrenewal projects out of the total of approved plans \r\n(Figure 11.4).\r\nUrban renewal is one of the most important tools \r\ncurrently used in Israel to provide solutions for \r\nthe shortage in housing units and for increasing \r\nbuilding resilience against earthquakes. In order to \r\nmeet the above objectives, government ministries, \r\nentrepreneurs and local authorities need to \r\ncontinue to jointly provide supportive tools, policy \r\nand legislative measures, and additional financial \r\nsolutions, to increase the rate of sustainable urban \r\nrenewal in demand areas and in the periphery, \r\nwhile fully cooperating, coordinating and creating \r\ncertainty for property owners. \r\nAccessible and sustainable \r\ntransport systems (SDG 11.2)\r\nDuring the last decade, the Israeli government \r\ninitiated major changes in its transport policy and \r\nbegan planning, developing and implementing \r\nmass transport systems in the four metropolitan \r\nareas (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa and Beersheba). In \r\nJerusalem, Israel’s first light rail line was opened \r\nin 2011, and two more lines will be added in the \r\nnext few years. In Tel Aviv, four light rail lines and \r\nthree underground lines are currently in different \r\nstages of planning and implementation.\r\nIn 2014, the National Public Transport Authority \r\n(NPTA) was established, as a support unit in the \r\nMinistry of Transport and Road Safety (MOT). Through \r\nthe NPTA, the government established new train lines, \r\nsignificantly increased budgets for public transport, \r\nand took important policy measures. These include \r\npromoting competition in the public transport sector, \r\nestablishing a new rate policy, initiating taxation \r\nchanges in the private vehicle sector, re-organizing \r\nthe public transport system in the most crowded area \r\nin Israel (the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area), introducing \r\ninnovative ticketing and information technologies \r\nand improving service levels. \r\nHowever, Israel still falls significantly behind OECD \r\ncountries, both in the infrastructure sector and \r\nthe complementary policy measures (Table 11.1). \r\nIn light of this, in 2012, the MOT and the Ministry \r\nof Finance prepared a “Strategic National Plan \r\nfor the Development of Public Transport.” The 25-\r\nyear plan revealed that Israel lags behind in such \r\nareas as cumulative investment in public transport \r\ninfrastructures, service level, extent of use of public \r\ntransport and split-mode travels, average speed of \r\npublic transportation, insufficient exclusive right￾of-way, and lack of diversity in travel modes and \r\nlevel of multi-modal integration. \r\nDespite new efforts to promote public transport, \r\ndata show that while private vehicle trips are \r\ndropping in OECD countries, the opposite trend is \r\nFigure 11.4\r\nUrban renewal housing units, by years Figure 11.4\r\n31,000\r\n26,000\r\n21,000\r\n8,182 6,506\r\n3,732 1,976\r\n2011 2013 2015 2017 2020* 2025* 2030*\r\nPercentage out of total approved plans\r\nPer Year*\r\n0\r\n8,000\r\n16,000\r\n24,000\r\n32,000\r\n35%\r\n25%\r\n20%\n\n202\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nTable 11.1\r\nSummary of indicative parameters in Israel’s metropolitan areas\r\nParameter/Metropolis Jerusalem Tel-Aviv Haifa Beersheba Parameter average in \r\ndeveloped metropolises as \r\nof 2010\r\nPT kms/resident/year \r\n(December 2017) 68.2 43.7 75.1 87 100 Vkm/inhab\r\nDaily average speed of PT \r\nnetwork (December 2017) 26 18 19 42 25 km/h\r\nNumber of public transport \r\nboardings/resident/year \r\n(December 2017)\r\n106 36 57 42 250 Br/inhab\r\nModal-split: percentage \r\nof work travels by public \r\ntransport (2017)\r\n22% 17% 15% 14% 40%\r\nLength (meters) of exclusive \r\npublic transport infrastructure \r\n(December 2018)\r\n26 35 60 5 150 m/1000 inhab\r\nFigure 11.5\r\nChanges in length of roads, km travelled and motor vehicles, 1970-2015.\r\nFigure 11.5\r\n1970 1975 1980 1885 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\r\n0\r\n200\r\n400\r\n600\r\n800\r\n1000\r\n1200\r\n1400\r\nIndex 1970 -100\r\n1162\r\n207\r\n930\r\nLength of paved roads (km)\r\nKilometer travelled (milion per year)\r\nMotor vehicles\r\nnoted in Israel. Examination of relevant data from \r\n2014 shows that the number of vehicles per 1 km \r\nof road was 2,700 (vehicles/km of road). Due to \r\nhigh vehicle density, the transport infrastructure \r\nis overloaded. The rate of increase of distances \r\ntravelled is particularly high in Israel, so that \r\nincreased road construction cannot provide the \r\nonly solution (Figure 11.5).\r\nIn recent years, a significant increase in the number \r\nof electric bikes in major Israeli cities has been \r\nnoted. Electric bikes are a convenient, quiet and \r\nenvironmentally friendly form of transportation \r\nwhich contribute to reducing congestion on the \r\nroads. However, the increased use of this mode of \r\ntransport has been accompanied by an increase \r\nin the number of injured in electric bike accidents, \r\nalthough a moderation was noted in 2017. \r\nThe MOT has prepared five strategic action \r\nplans in recent years which form the basis for \r\nits implementation policy. These plans address \n\n203\r\nGOAL 11\r\ninvestments in public and urban non-motorized \r\ntransport, integration of policy measures to encourage \r\nthe use of these transport modes and land-use, \r\nand transport policies that will enable sustainable \r\naccessibility. The main component in the strategic \r\nplans is the promotion of public transport services. \r\nTo measure Israel’s progress toward accessible \r\nand sustainable public transport, the following \r\nlocal indicators are recommended for Israel:\r\n• Modal-Split: percentage of travels by public \r\ntransport: This suggested indicator, which \r\nlargely relates to the percentage of travelers by \r\npublic transport, is an important tool to evaluate \r\nsustainable transport development for a city \r\nor a defined area. The average modal-split for \r\ndeveloped metropolises in the world is 40%, \r\nwhile in Israel it is only 17%. As can be seen in \r\nTable 11.1, as of 2017, the modal split-level in \r\nJerusalem was 22% and in Tel Aviv, Beersheba \r\nand Haifa between 15% and 17%\r\n• Length (km) of exclusive public transport \r\ninfrastructure (December 2018): This suggested \r\nindicator evaluates the service level as well as the \r\nadvancement in public transport development in \r\nthe city. The average distance traveled by public \r\ntransportation in exclusive public transport \r\ninfrastructure in developed metropolises in the \r\nworld is 100 km/resident, while in Israel it is \r\n68.5 km/resident.\r\nInclusive and sustainable \r\nurbanization (SDG 11.3)\r\nInclusive urbanization and participatory human \r\nsettlement planning are important elements \r\nin Israel’s Planning and Building Law (1965). \r\nThe planning system is comprised of three \r\norganizational levels – national, regional and local \r\n– with representatives of government ministries \r\nand agencies and local authorities as well as \r\nrepresentatives of professional organizations and \r\nthe public at some of the levels. \r\nIn general, three different levels of citizen \r\nengagement can be identified in planning: citizen \r\ninformation whereby information is conveyed from \r\nthe government to the public, citizen consultation \r\nwhereby the government initiates processes \r\nallowing citizens to voice their opinions, and citizen \r\nparticipation and empowerment based on a two￾way dialogue whereby planning solutions take both \r\nparties’ views into consideration.\r\nThe Planning and Building Law requires the following: \r\n• Plan deposition (partial citizen consultation): \r\nThe law stipulates that the plan approval process \r\nbe conditional on a two-month plan “deposition” \r\nto allow for stakeholders’ objections. The law \r\ndefines stakeholders (mostly owners, part owners, \r\nneighbors and relevant professional organizations) \r\nand sets procedural limitations with respect to \r\nthe time and manner of objecting to plans, but \r\nit clearly empowers the most affected parties \r\nand assures that their voice is heard, and their \r\nobjections are part of the public record.\r\n• Transparency in plan-related information (citizen \r\ninformation): Israel is strengthening its policies \r\non the sharing of planning information. The trend \r\nis reflected in recent planning law amendments, \r\nmost notably in Amendment 101 (2014). This \r\namendment significantly reinforced transparency \r\nrequirements with regard to both plan content \r\n(documents must be on public display from the day \r\nof plan submittal) and decision-making processes \r\n(planning committees’ decisions must be published \r\nwithin three days of meeting dates). Publication \r\nof information on the web is a legal requirement.\r\nIsrael has introduced system-wide digitalization of \r\nplanning and permitting processes that sets new \r\nbenchmarks for the accessibility of planning data to \r\nthe general public. Significantly, it includes an online \r\nplan submittal system and a recently released online \r\nsystem for submitting building permit applications. \r\nBoth systems enable the orderly viewing of data, \r\nthus improving the ease and quality of public \r\ninvolvement. Today, many planning agencies extend \r\npublic participation practices well beyond the legal \r\nrequirements as shown in the following examples:\r\n• Local comprehensive plans include four public \r\nmeetings throughout the planning process \r\nto obtain public input with respect to present \r\nconditions, strategic vision, draft plan alternatives \n\n204\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nand selected, individual issues of local importance;\r\n• The preparation of subject-oriented national master \r\nplans is accompanied by an extensive stakeholder \r\nand/or citizen participation process. Typically, it \r\ninvolves meetings with stakeholders, an “Editors \r\nCommittee” including stakeholders’ representatives, \r\nand publicized meetings with the general public; \r\n• A structured plan for citizen participation is required \r\nas a pre-condition to formal plan submittals in \r\nsome types of plans processed by the National \r\nPlanning and Building Committee for Prioritized \r\nHousing Areas (Vatmal). The Vatmal is a legislative \r\nfast track for large housing plans, mostly on \r\ngovernment-owned land, which was established \r\nin 2014 for five years with an option of extension;\r\n• Extensive public participation is typical of \r\nurban regeneration projects in which the \r\nassent of property owners is required by law. \r\nThe Urban Renewal Authority is promoting \r\nseveral citizen participation processes in urban \r\nrenewal plans such as detailed plans in the local \r\nauthorities’ track, detailed plans in the taxation \r\ntrack (entrepreneurial), guidelines for citizen \r\nparticipation processes in the 18 urban renewal \r\nadministrations and a guide on the preparation \r\nof a social report on urban renewal projects.\r\nIn October 2018, the Urban Renewal Authority \r\npublished a guide which aims to involve and include \r\nproperty owners and the entire community in the \r\nplanning processes of urban renewal projects. The \r\nguide elaborates on the tools and stages at which \r\npublic participation should be integrated, and on \r\nmeans of drafting recommendations that can later \r\nbe implemented in the planning process and used \r\nthroughout the different stages of the project.\r\nIn recent years, due to the increase in urban renewal \r\nprojects, the degree of citizen participation in \r\nplanning processes has risen as well. This rise has \r\nbeen supported both by the government, through \r\nits Urban Renewal Authority arm, and by property \r\nowners who are given the opportunity to participate \r\nin project meetings at initial planning stages. \r\nA locally-relevant indicator has been suggested for \r\nIsrael which relates to the number of status updates \r\nto property holders and tenants during a project’s \r\nplanning process: a semi-annual update for an \r\noutline plan and a quarterly update for a detailed \r\nplan. Status reports may include site conferences, \r\nresident meetings, letters, and other official updates.\r\nProtection of cultural and natural \r\nheritage (SDG 11.4)\r\nNatural and cultural heritage sites in Israel’s cities \r\nare an integral part of the urban landscape. The \r\nintensive urbanization and development processes \r\nthat have taken place in Israel in recent decades \r\npresent challenges to the planning and conservation \r\nof open spaces, natural values and local cultural \r\nand heritage sites. In the face of these challenges, \r\nnational master plans (NMPs) have been promoted \r\nand approved for national parks and nature reserves \r\n(NMP 8), forests (NMP 22), seashores (NMP 13), and \r\nmore, as well as a strategic plan for open spaces.\r\nAs part of an ongoing global trend, cities in Israel \r\nhave also begun to implement actions directed \r\ntowards the conservation of natural and cultural \r\nsites, and changes of approach are taking place \r\namong decision makers as well as the general public. \r\nWhile it was previously believed that local authorities \r\nhave no part in nature conservation, in the last \r\ndecade meaningful progress has been made \r\ntowards understanding the importance of urban \r\nnature conservation as part of the national effort \r\nto protect Israel’s biodiversity. For example, as a \r\nfirst step towards protecting urban natural areas \r\nand assimilating this field in municipal policy and \r\nmanagement, cities have begun to map their urban \r\nnatural areas. Between 2008 and 2018, 26 urban \r\nnature surveys were completed, and 24 more are \r\nin different execution stages.\r\nFindings from the last decade’s urban nature \r\nsurveys suggest that valuable open spaces, rare \r\nhabitats, endangered species and unique natural \r\nassets of national and regional importance exist \r\nin many municipal areas. Today, a few models for \r\nthe management of the different natural areas \r\nin the urban environment can be found in Israel. \r\nExamples of nature site preservation in cities \r\ninclude the Coral Beach Reserve in Eilat, Apollonia \n\n205\r\nGOAL 11\r\nNational Park in Herzliya, the Community Forest \r\nin Rosh Ha’ayin, and the Haifa wadis.\r\nThe conservation of urban cultural heritage sites \r\nis also of major importance. The many cultural \r\nheritage sites in Israel, from different historical \r\nperiods, are witness to the variety of cultures and \r\nevents that took place in the country. Urban heritage \r\nconservation may range from preserving a single \r\nmonument to preserving the historic old city at the \r\nheart of a municipality. In Israel, such sites include \r\narcheological or historic assets and buildings as \r\nwell as areas designated for preservation such as \r\nthe remains of old cities, ports, streets, markets \r\nor specific architectural styles. Throughout the \r\nyears, laws and other measures have influenced \r\nthe protection of cultural heritage sites in the urban \r\nenvironment. Today, several bodies are involved in \r\nthe preservation of urban cultural heritage sites, but \r\neach usually focuses on a specific historical period \r\nor interest, with no single authority responsible for \r\nmanaging and leading this field.\r\nSignificant government support for the preservation \r\nof national heritage sites in Israel has been \r\nprovided by means of the “Landmarks” program \r\ninitiated by the Ministry of Jerusalem and Heritage. \r\nThe ministry’s Heritage Department operates at \r\ntwo main levels: supporting projects to preserve \r\nnational heritage infrastructures and promoting \r\nnational policy and strategy.\r\nThe conservation of local cultural heritage and \r\nnatural values has a key role in urban development. \r\nOf high importance is the empowerment of local \r\nauthorities to promote natural and cultural \r\nCASE STUDY\r\nUrban Nature in Jerusalem\r\nIsrael’s first urban nature survey was conducted in Jerusalem. Among several unique sites \r\nidentified is the Gazelle Valley in the southern part of the city, confined between several \r\nresidential neighborhoods. The site has a rich and significant biodiversity, including a herd \r\nof mountain gazelles. The site’s development caters to the needs of the general public, \r\nand especially the surrounding neighborhoods whose residents are active partners in the \r\nmaintenance and development of the site. The Gazelle Valley Park is very popular and is an \r\nexcellent example of a successful urban nature park.\r\nThe Gazelle Valley, Jerusalem/Photo: Gazelle Park Team\n\n206\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nheritage sites under their jurisdiction by completing \r\ntheir heritage database and implementing \r\nappropriate policies and plans in their municipal \r\nsystems. The multiplicity of bodies involved in the \r\nconservation efforts sharpens the need for a more \r\nholistic, unifying management approach under \r\ngovernmental responsibility, which will include the \r\naccompaniment, regulation and support of local \r\nurban initiatives and overall supervision of this field. \r\nDisaster impact reduction, climate \r\nchange adaptation and resilience to \r\ndisasters (SDG 11.5, 11.b)\r\nIsrael has a comprehensive emergency and \r\npreparedness mechanism, headed by the National \r\nEmergency Management Authority (NEMA), under \r\nthe Ministry of Defense. NEMA is responsible \r\nfor compiling national hazard assessments and \r\ndirecting and coordinating preparedness and \r\nresponse of government offices, infrastructures \r\nand local authorities in case of emergency. \r\nNEMA defines the range and probability of risks \r\nIsrael faces, including the following: \r\n• Natural disasters: Earthquakes and tsunamis, \r\nextreme heat and droughts. \r\n• Man-made disasters: Fires, terrorism and war, \r\ncyber-attacks and hazardous materials events.\r\nA dedicated plan is in place for each type of hazard, with \r\nregular exercises to ensure readiness. On the local level, \r\ncities are obliged by law to establish a local emergency \r\ndeployment committee and to prepare a municipal \r\nemergency portfolio. However, the natural disaster \r\nCASE STUDY\r\nThe “White City” of Tel Aviv\r\nThe “White City” of Tel Aviv was declared a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003. \r\nAccording to the inscription, Tel Aviv is a prominent example of the “various trends of the \r\nModern Movement in architecture and city planning at the beginning of the 20th century.” \r\nAs part of the process, the Tel Aviv municipality committed to prepare a statutory protection \r\nplan for the historical buildings and fabric of the “White City.” \r\nIn 2008, the Tel Aviv conservation plan was approved, identifying approximately 1,000 historical \r\nbuildings designated for statutory protection, the majority of which are located in the White \r\nCity’s officially designated limits\r\nBen Yehuda Street, Tel Aviv/Photo: Wikipedia\n\n207\r\nGOAL 11\r\nframework, outlined by the state, only includes fires \r\nand earthquakes, with no reference to storms or floods.\r\nIn December 1999, the Israeli government \r\nestablished a Steering Committee for Earthquake \r\nPreparedness to lead and coordinate actions. The \r\ncurrent assessment defines a 16%-26% chance \r\nof a major earthquake in the next 20-30 years, \r\nwith approximately 7,000 fatalities. Preparedness \r\nfor earthquakes is widespread, substantiated \r\nby building codes, a national master plan and \r\nnumerous financial tools. The Earthquake Building \r\nStandard was instated in 1975, followed by a \r\ndedicated master plan intended to create economic \r\nincentives for structural strengthening of buildings \r\nbuilt before 1980, but actual implementation \r\nremains limited. In 2014, a tsunami assessment \r\nwas compiled. Consequently, the assessment was \r\ntranslated into preparedness plans and drills in \r\nlocal authorities along the Mediterranean coast.\r\nAs most of Israel’s local authorities are small and \r\nlacking in financial resources, a sliding index for \r\nresilience support has been developed to ensure that \r\nthe budgetary standing of the municipality does not \r\nreflect on its disaster preparedness. The sliding index \r\nis a compilation of the municipality’s vulnerability \r\nwith its financial and administrative robustness. \r\nIsrael recognizes that those living in poverty, who \r\ncomprise 21% of the Israeli population, are the \r\nmost vulnerable in any extreme event and require \r\ndedicated municipal and government responsiveness \r\nin order to ensure their safety and resilience. \r\nTherefore, schemes for disadvantaged communities \r\nand populations include special housing solutions \r\nand dedicated plans in times of emergency. \r\nWhile most local authorities in Israel have effective \r\nemergency systems in place, they do not have \r\ncontingency plans for climate changes, in particular \r\nfor the impacts of increased heat and infrastructure \r\ndegradation due to extreme weather. In Israel, \r\nclimate trends already indicate temperature rise \r\nand more extreme weather events, resulting in local \r\nflooding and prevalence of heat islands in cities, \r\nwith the likelihood that the intensity of precipitation \r\nevents will increase along with sea level rises (Israel \r\nMeteorological Service, 2016 data). \r\nNumerous impacts of extreme weather events are \r\nalready evident in Israel:\r\n• Flooding is on the increase in winter in many urban \r\nareas. While most local authorities have contingency \r\nplans for rare flood events, plans and building codes \r\nneed to be adapted in light of the significant increase \r\nMediterranean coastal cliff/Photo: Photo Yossi Uzi Ltd.\n\n208\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nin the number of such events. A policy paper on \r\nrunoff management in urban areas is in preparation. \r\n• Shade is becoming a critical asset for the urban \r\nenvironment. As heat increases and water \r\nresources decrease, the livability of cities depends \r\nmore and more on the availability of shaded areas. \r\n• Coastal cliff erosion is risking 10-50 meters high \r\nlime cliffs, along 45 km of Israel’s Mediterranean \r\nshoreline. Cliffs are retreating by dozens of \r\ncentimeters each year on average. Some have \r\nbegun to collapse, endangering people and \r\nstructures and creating a budgetary constraint \r\non local authorities. In light of this concern, a \r\nNational Master Plan for the Protection of Coastal \r\nCliffs along the Mediterranean was approved, \r\nenabling the implementation of coastal and \r\nmaritime protections while preserving, to the \r\nextent possible, the cliff’s natural configuration. \r\nThe second decade of the 21st century began with \r\na number of extreme weather events which led to \r\ndisastrous consequences. For example, in December \r\n2010, a major fire tore through the Carmel Mountain. \r\nThe fire was extinguished after four days, during which \r\nforty-four people lost their lives and approximately \r\n17,000 residents were evacuated, alongside extensive \r\nproperty damage. In December 2013, Israel was hit \r\nby an unusually extreme snowstorm which primarily \r\naffected the northern and central areas of the country. \r\nTrees fell on top of power lines, and many residents \r\nwere besieged in their own homes with no access to \r\nbasic products and no means of heating.\r\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Environmental Protection \r\n(MOEP) published a National Assessment of \r\nClimate Change Impacts, which relates, inter alia, \r\nto recommendations on climate change adaptation \r\nat the local level. In addition, the State Comptroller \r\npublished a special report about the preparedness \r\nof local authorities for extreme weather conditions. \r\nThis triggered a reevaluation of the existing \r\nmechanisms and existing emergency scenarios, \r\nincluding a July 2018 government decision to \r\nimplement the National Program for Adaptation \r\nto Climate Change and the establishment of \r\nan Inter-ministerial Administration for Climate \r\nChange Adaptation and a Sub-committee for Local \r\nAdaptation. The administration is responsible for \r\nthe implementation of the national program, aimed \r\nat preparing for and coping with climate changes \r\nand extreme weather events (see SDG 13.1).\r\nCurrently, there is no structured data compilation \r\nof impacts and economic losses due to natural \r\ndisasters, neither at the governmental level nor at \r\nthe local level. Towards the end of 2018, the State \r\nComptroller issued a report on the 2016 fires, \r\nidentifying them as the worst disaster in terms of \r\ndamage to property and the environment: more \r\nthan 40 km2\r\n of land were burnt, and total damages \r\nsurpassed $176 million.\r\nFigure 11.6\r\nNatural disaster events in Israel 2007-2018\r\nFigure 11.6\r\n2\r\n5 5\r\n4\r\n3\r\n1 1 1 1\r\n2 2\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n10\r\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\r\nnumber of events\r\nExtreme Heat\r\nDrought\r\nFires\r\nStorms and Floods\n\n209\r\nGOAL 11\r\nWaste management in cities\r\n(SDG 11.6)\r\nThe Ministry of Environmental Protection (MOEP) \r\nis responsible for waste management regulation \r\nin Israel. Local authorities are responsible for the \r\ncollection of urban waste and waste disposal to \r\ndesignated waste disposal sites.\r\nIsrael’s residents produce approximately 1.7 kg \r\nof waste per day. In 2017 about 5.4 million tons of \r\nmunicipal waste were produced, of which 22.4% \r\nwere recycled, a 2% improvement over the previous \r\nyear. Over the last two decades, separation at \r\nsource of various waste streams, with government \r\nsupport, has been introduced into local authorities \r\nand businesses. Municipal waste is collected in \r\nbins in residents’ homes and in commercial centers \r\nor separated at source of collection into different \r\nwaste streams. These streams include paper and \r\ncardboard, plastic bottles, organic waste, garden \r\nwaste and electronic waste. Designated receptacles \r\nand centers have been set up for specific waste \r\ncomponents in local authorities throughout the \r\ncountry (see SDG 12.4, 12.5). \r\nAir Pollution Reduction in Cities \r\n(SDG 11.6)\r\nTransportation is recognized as a major contributor \r\nto air pollution in urban areas and exceedances \r\nof air quality standards measured in monitoring \r\nstations in city centers confirm that air pollution in \r\nIsrael’s cities is primarily caused by motor vehicles. \r\nGreen and public spaces\r\n(SDG 11.7)\r\nWhile public space is universally accepted \r\nto be one of the most important components of \r\nvibrant, equitable cities, it defies attempts at a clear \r\ndefinition. The role of the public space is strongly \r\naffected by local culture, climate, resources, \r\ntopography and other local factors. As a result, \r\ncreating effective policy-making and management \r\nrelated to the public space is quite challenging, \r\nfurther complicated by the fact that best practices \r\noften do not transfer well between cities.\r\nPlastic bottle collection/Photo: Ilan Malester\n\n210\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nCASE STUDY\r\nReducing Air Pollution from Transportation in Haifa Bay and \r\nJerusalem\r\nIn the wake of government decisions taken in 2015 and 2017, Israel’s first Low Emission Zone \r\n(LEZ) was established in Haifa Bay. According to the decisions, which were backed up by a \r\nmunicipal bylaw, polluting diesel vehicles are prohibited from entering and parking in the \r\nLEZs, unless equipped with a particulate filter. To facilitate implementation of the decision, \r\nsubsidies are provided to owners of polluting diesel vehicles to enable the installation of \r\nparticulate filters in vehicles in the Haifa Bay region. The first stage of the program was \r\nlaunched in February 2018 and related to polluting vehicles weighing over 3.5 tons with \r\nthe second stage following in January 2019 and relating to polluting vehicles less than \r\n3.5 tons (including taxis and commercial cars). The program is accompanied by a multi￾faceted awareness-raising campaign. Implementation of these measures throughout all the \r\nresidential areas of Haifa is expected to bring about a 23% reduction in vehicular pollution \r\nand a significant improvement in air quality. \r\nIn a related development, a breakthrough in efforts to reduce air pollution from transportation \r\nin Jerusalem was achieved in May 2017 within the framework of a government decision, \r\nbacked up by a municipal bylaw. As Israel’s most populated city, Jerusalem has long been \r\nplagued by air pollution from transportation sources, with exceedances of particulate and \r\nnitrogen oxide standards recorded near major transportation arteries. While improvements \r\nin air quality in the city center were achieved following the launch of Jerusalem’s light rail \r\nin 2011, the government decision to implement a LEZ in Jerusalem, to assist owners of old \r\ndiesel vehicles to install particulate filters and to allocate funds for the purchase of electric \r\nbuses should further reduce air pollution in the city.\r\nHaifa Low Emission Zone/Photo: Ronen Lotan\n\n211\r\nGOAL 11\r\nThe main national policy for public spaces in \r\nIsrael is the “Directory for Allocation of Land \r\nfor Public Use,” which was updated in 2018. The \r\ndirectory recommends allocating a minimum of \r\n10 m2\r\n of public space per resident, and it sets \r\nminimum allocations of public spaces at defined, \r\nmaximum distances, as measured by travel time \r\nby foot, bicycle or public transportation, to ensure \r\naccessibility. In addition, at least 80% of the public \r\nspaces in each municipality are to be green open \r\nspaces, such as parks, gardens and natural sites. \r\nNumerous practical guides for planning various \r\naspects of the public space have been published \r\nby several ministries, including the MOCH, the \r\nMOEP and the IPA, as well as by municipalities \r\nand NGOs. In 2017, a voluntary standard for \r\nsustainable neighborhoods (Neighborhood 360°) \r\nwas developed, which places emphasis on public \r\nspaces and their quality.\r\nAs minimum allocations of public space have been \r\nmandatory in Israel since the 1970s, including \r\ndefined maximum distances from residential areas. \r\nUN Habitat’s recommendation for a minimum of \r\n15% open space is met in half of Israel’s cities \r\n(defined as having more than 2,000 residents), \r\nincluding all large cities with more than 100,000 \r\nresidents. Of the cities which are deficient in public \r\nspace, especially small cities (under 100,000 \r\nresidents), approximately 70% are cities in which \r\nthe land is mostly privately owned. In these cities, \r\nongoing legal and planning efforts are taken to \r\nalleviate the lack of public space. \r\nCurrently, Israel’s large cities have sufficient \r\nmunicipal public space. As a result, efforts are \r\nconcentrated on improving the quality of existing \r\nmunicipal public spaces as well as those planned \r\nfor new developments, and on creating additional \r\npublic space in cities where land is for the most \r\npart privately owned. \r\nThe MOCH has prepared a publication entitled \r\n“Reviving the Public Space” and distributed it to \r\nheads of local authorities in Israel. The booklet is \r\na compilation of best practices designed by local \r\nauthorities and residents, in the form of a catalog \r\nfrom which local authorities can pick projects to \r\nimplement in their jurisdictions.\r\nTwo of the most pressing issues affecting the \r\nquality of public space in Israel are lack of defined \r\nmanagement responsibility and lack of quantified, \r\nmonitored quality indicators. These issues have \r\nbeen identified by government bodies, by NGOs and \r\nby academia, and work is currently underway in all \r\nthree sectors to create and to implement solutions. \r\nAs part of the ongoing efforts to address these two \r\nissues, two locally-relevant indicators are suggested: \r\nFigure 11.7\r\nNumber of cities with sufficient public space \r\nFigure 11.7\r\n12\r\n31\r\n49\r\n6\r\n10\r\n15\r\n45\r\n12\r\n7 8 0\r\n20\r\n40\r\n60\r\n80\r\n100\r\n2,000 - 5,000 5,000 - 10,000 10,000 - 50,000 50,000 - 100,000 100,000 - 200,000 more than\r\n200,000\r\nNumber of cities\r\nNumber of residents\r\nSufficient\r\nInsufficient\n\n212\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\n• Number of large cities evaluating the creation of \r\na neighborhood level of management, including \r\nstrategies to manage the public space.\r\n• Evaluation of internationally accepted plans to \r\nmonitor and evaluate public space, including \r\ntheir adaptation for the Israeli context, and \r\nthe creation of implementation policies at the \r\nmunicipal and national levels.\r\nNational and regional \r\ndevelopment planning (SDG 11.a)\r\nIn view of the need to balance development with \r\nthe protection of natural areas and open spaces, \r\nin 2005 the government adopted National Master \r\nPlan (NMP) 35, which incorporates sustainable \r\ngrowth principles. NMP 35 is a state-wide spatial \r\nplan. This strategic, map-based plan divides the \r\ncountry into five planning designations (termed \r\n“textures”), some development-oriented and some \r\npreservation-oriented:\r\n• Urban: Compact urban development, high \r\ndensity, and urban quality of life;\r\n• Rural: Rural settlements, agricultural land, \r\ntourism and employment, and contiguous open \r\nspace;\r\n• National preserved: Large continuous spaces \r\nof natural importance, agricultural and scenic \r\nlandscapes, etc.;\r\n• Mixed preserved: “Green” corridor encompassing \r\nnatural areas, agriculture and heritage, \r\nrunning the length of the country, bounded \r\nby urban settlements;\r\n• Coastal: Coastal land conservation and \r\npublic access to the sea and the beaches.\r\nThe provisions of NMP 35 differentiate between \r\nthe textures – supporting development processes \r\nin development-oriented areas, while restricting \r\nthe extent of development in preservation-oriented \r\nareas. Several variables, such as maximum \r\nsize of the municipality or its minimal density, \r\nare determined for each texture (urban texture \r\nexcluded). The plan structures the urban texture \r\nin coordination with the road and mass transit \r\nnetworks and emphasizes public transport and \r\nenvironmental sustainability.\r\nCASE STUDY\r\nCommunity Gardens\r\nHundreds of community gardens have been established throughout Israel with the support \r\nand/or cooperation of local authorities, NGOs, and government ministries. Over the past \r\ncouple of decades, neglected plots in densely populated urban areas have been turned into \r\ncommunity gardens with the direct involvement of nearby residents. \r\nWhile most of the gardens were originally established in Israel’s central cities, recent years \r\nhave seen a proliferation of community gardens in peripheral areas as well. In addition \r\nto helping to preserve urban nature and open space, these gardens have helped develop \r\na sense of environmental responsibility and empowerment among residents. They offer \r\nrest and relaxation as well as social interaction with neighbors. Residents who take part \r\nin the cultivation of community gardens report a sense of pride and belonging, a feeling \r\nof camaraderie, and a realization that they can make a difference in the quality of life and \r\nenvironment of their neighborhood.\r\nAn inter-ministerial National Committee for Community Gardening was established in 2009, \r\nwith representatives hailing from government ministries, municipalities and NGOs. The \r\ncommittee aims to coordinate the resources and promote collaboration among stakeholders. \n\n213\r\nGOAL 11\r\nThe interfaces between rural and urban \r\nsettlements in Israel are a major challenge \r\nin rural development, and the rural-urban \r\ninterrelationships are a critical component \r\nfor regional growth. In 2015, the Ministry of \r\nAgriculture and Rural Development published \r\na policy paper that addresses this urban-rural \r\ninterface. The methodology that lays the foundation \r\nfor the analysis of the urban-rural interfaces \r\nreflects a spatial and inclusive regionally-linked \r\nplanning perception that emphasizes several basic \r\nassumptions. Firstly, the urban-rural affinity is \r\na main component in growth patterns, both in \r\nthe relative qualities and merits of each sphere \r\nand of both as a whole. Secondly, the rural￾urban interface (physical and functional) needs \r\nto change from “a space of conflict” to “a space \r\nof opportunities,” regarding growth patterns, \r\ncollaborations and regeneration. Thirdly, sensitive, \r\nwell-adapted planning regarding the urban-rural \r\naffinity features will enable the development of \r\nbetter models of ruralism and urbanism. The \r\nmethodology is based on the following principles, \r\nadapted to the reality in Israel and to the national \r\nplanning policy:\r\n• Urban-rural affinities as the basis for defining \r\nthe rural area’s role in the spatial unit: The \r\nurban-rural affinity’s characteristics change in \r\naccordance with the specific spatial area. Hence, \r\nplanning must take account of the role of the \r\nrural sub-area in the spatial unit and reflect it \r\nwhile considering the affinity characteristics \r\nbetween it and the relevant cities. The analysis \r\nand incorporation of such affinities in planning \r\nconsiderations are the foundations for defining \r\nplanning guidelines which enhance the rural \r\narea’s uniqueness and its added value to the \r\nentire region’s growth. \r\n• Multidisciplinary analysis encouraging an \r\ninclusive regional perspective: The affinity \r\nanalysis must be based not only on population \r\nsize and the relative population sizes of the \r\nrural vs. the urban areas, but must also take \r\ninto account social, economic, demographic and \r\nenvironmental aspects.\r\n• Flexibility – no need for division to fixed sub￾areas: Since Israel is a small country, it is \r\nunnecessary to divide the land into sub-divisions \r\nor define “closed” and “open” sub-areas.\r\nIn addition to NMP 35, fifty additional national \r\noutline plans exist along with hundreds of partial \r\nplans, most of which deal with detailed or specific \r\nareas. Every plan highlights a certain aspect in the \r\nnational planning system. Due to the multiplicity of \r\nplans and the many complexities, it is necessary to \r\nupdate, renew, and convert all plans into one unified \r\n“language.” Therefore, in 2013, the National Building \r\nand Planning Council decided to establish one, unified \r\nNMP (NMP 1) that will unify all detailed outline plans. \r\nCASE STUDY\r\nThe Regional Clusters Program\r\nThe regional clusters program is intended as part of MOINs policy and strategy to promote \r\neconomic growth at the periphery, to narrow gaps between communities, to develop economic \r\nties between a city and its rural environment, and to strengthen national and regional \r\nplanning. The program was initiated and led by the MOIN in cooperation and with the Ministry \r\nof Finance and JDC Israel. \r\nThe clustering concept is based on the understanding that systemic and sustainable solutions \r\nare needed to cope with the challenges faced by peripheral local authorities. A cluster of \r\nauthorities creates an opportunity and a platform that helps overcome regional failures by \r\nleveraging local and regional resources and improving the authorities’ ability to promote the \n\n214\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nwelfare of the residents. Essentially, such a cluster enjoys economies of scale, enabling the \r\nauthorities involved to reduce costs and maximize benefits. As a result, the local authorities \r\nassociated with the cluster can improve a large array of municipal services such as garbage \r\ndisposal or regional veterinary systems.\r\nRegional clusters enable the establishment of a regional strategy that deepens internal \r\nconnections within the region while expanding external connections with actors operating \r\nbeyond municipal boundaries: government ministries, the third sector, academia and \r\nresearch bodies, entrepreneurs, and the business sector. This local and national integration \r\nfacilitates the development of a comprehensive plan and better realization of regional assets \r\nand resources, thus strengthening regional cohesion and reducing socio-economic gaps.\r\nJoining the cluster also enables local authorities to create a strong regional voice and to \r\ninfluence policy makers in central government. The joint voice increases the cluster’s ability to \r\nenlist partners from government ministries and philanthropy, thereby significantly increasing \r\nthe mobilization of new resources. A clear expression of this was found in the successful \r\njoint activity of several clusters that called upon the government to produce a comprehensive \r\nplan for the development of the Northern District. \r\nFurthermore, the cluster’s activity is aimed at reducing economic and social gaps between \r\nneighboring authorities and between center and periphery. This is done through the following: \r\n• strengthening the ability of all the authorities associated with the cluster, with special \r\nemphasis on the weak ones, to provide optimal services to their residents;\r\n• creating a social mix of authorities in the cluster, with strong ones supporting weaker ones \r\nthrough partnership and joint regional activity, thus improving the welfare of the residents \r\nof the entire region and reducing gaps within the cluster;\r\n• pooling of resources to achieve regional growth insofar that the whole is greater than the \r\nsum of its parts;\r\n• creating mutual working interfaces and common living spaces that promote social cohesion \r\nbetween residents, communities and populations that make up the cluster. \r\nThe first cluster, the Western Galilee Cluster, was established as a regional corporation with \r\nover 150,000 residents by several local authorities in 2009. This initiative, which was adopted \r\nby the Ministry of Interior, served as the first pilot and inspired the development of other \r\nclusters in the periphery. \r\nThe number of regional clusters increased from 5 to 10 between 2016 and 2018. During these \r\nyears, the number of local authorities associated with the clusters increased from 59 to 109, \r\nand the scope of budgetary activity increased from NIS 15 million (about $4.16 million) to \r\nNIS 220 million (about $61 million). Numerous initiatives born of the partnerships formed \r\nwithin the clusters flourished in recent years including a unique science education system, \r\nregional centers for people with disabilities, joint transportation systems, garbage treatment \r\nprojects, and more. Among the subjects proposed for future cooperation are environmental \r\nenforcement and waste treatment, sports and cultural activities, joint planning of public \r\ntransportation, tourism, industrial parks, emergency preparedness, and regional frameworks \r\nfor populations with special needs. \n\n215\r\nGOAL 11\r\nTo address the problem of inequalities resulting \r\nfrom past zoning divisions between cities and to \r\npromote a regional and systematic point of view, \r\nthe Ministry of Interior (MOIN) has established \r\nseven geographical committees charged with \r\ncontinually examining the municipal area under \r\ntheir responsibility. Each committee is responsible \r\nfor an area that comprises between 40 and 60 \r\nlocal authorities, linked regionally and spatially. \r\nThe committees examine various issues such as \r\nchanging municipal boundaries, better income \r\ndivisions from profitable areas such as commercial, \r\nindustrial and services areas, army bases, quarries \r\nand more. In addition, they are responsible for \r\ndeciding on changes of municipal entities, from local \r\ncouncils to municipalities (cities), and sometimes \r\neven on the unification of local authorities. In \r\naddition, a regional clusters initiative is being \r\npromoted with the aim of promoting regional \r\ncooperation among neighboring local authorities \r\nin the periphery by leveraging size advantages to \r\nachieve economic efficiency, improve services to \r\nresidents and narrow socio-economic gaps. \r\n(Please see the stakeholders’ annex at the end \r\nof this report for some input from NGOs in Israel \r\nto SDG 11)\r\nPARTNERING FOR A BETTER WORLD \r\nIsrael’s international development cooperation \r\nprogram collaborates with UN specialized agencies \r\nto promote a multi-disciplinary approach to \r\nintegrated regional development. Acting as the \r\nfocal point for UN Habitat in Israel, the Ministry of \r\nConstruction and Housing (MOCH) is leading the \r\nprocesses of policy planning and implementation \r\nin the fields of urbanism, urban planning and \r\ndevelopment, public and social housing, affordable \r\nhousing, new construction methods, and the \r\nassimilation of advanced technology and innovation \r\nin the construction industry. The ministry is \r\ncurrently taking part in an international Working \r\nGroup on Affordable Housing, headed by the \r\nTransport and Urban Development Department of \r\nthe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), to promote \r\nhousing solutions across the region. (SDG 11.1)\r\nIn 2016, MOCH led Israel’s delegation at the UN \r\nConference on Housing and Sustainable Urban \r\nDevelopment (Habitat III) in Quito, Ecuador. Habitat \r\nIII offered member states the opportunity to discuss \r\nthe New Urban Agenda, focusing on policies and \r\nstrategies that can result in effectively harnessing \r\nthe power and forces behind urbanization. Israel \r\nstrongly supported the Quito Declaration on \r\nSustainable Cities and Human Settlements for All, \r\nand UN General Assembly Resolution (71/256) on \r\nthe New Urban Agenda. (SDG 11.3) \r\nIn light of Israel’s support of the New Urban Agenda, \r\nMASHAV hosted a delegation of UN Habitat officials \r\non a study mission to explore the opportunity of \r\njoint programming in Africa. The parties agreed \r\nto conduct three pilot programs in Kenya, Uganda \r\nand Liberia. Israel’s Embassy in Nairobi is working \r\ntogether with UN Habitat on capacity-building \r\nactivities designed to respond to the needs of youth \r\nin agriculture, service delivery, employment and \r\nincome-generation. In the past (2015), MASHAV \r\nand UN Habitat conducted a special training course \r\non Bringing Women and Girls into the Cityscape, \r\nfocusing on gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women in urban planning. (SDG 11.3, 5.5)\r\nWithin the framework of Habitat III, MASHAV, the \r\nYoung American Business Trust (YABT) and UN \r\nHabitat organized a side event on Israel’s Urban￾Innovational Platforms. Among the organizational \r\nplatforms presented included: Municipal Innovation \r\n– Case Study: Vietnam; Municipal Platforms \r\nfor Local Economic Development and Revenue \r\nEnhancement – Case Study: Kenya; The Gender \r\nand Local Government UN Habitat/MASHAV Joint \r\nProgram – 10 Years and Beyond; and Business \r\nLabs for Young Entrepreneurs – Methodology and \r\nShowcases. (SDG 11.a) \r\nAt the Israeli Pavilion at Habitat III, the NGO Access \r\nIsrael introduced the Accessibility Path, focusing \n\n216\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\non adapting the urban environment to the needs of \r\nevery resident, especially people with disabilities \r\nand the elderly. The event stressed the challenges \r\npeople with disabilities and the aged confront in \r\nan urban setting. (SDG 11.7)\r\nMOCH signed a bilateral cooperation agreement \r\nwith the Russian Ministry of Construction, Housing \r\nand Utilities as part of the Joint Israeli-Russian \r\nCommission on Trade and Cooperation. Two \r\nmeetings of the Joint Working Group were held on \r\nissues including legal and technical regulations, \r\npurchaser’s rights, increasing energy efficiency, \r\nbuilding exploitation, urban renewal, housing \r\nprovision for targeted populations, the sale of \r\nstate-owned lands to entrepreneurs, capacity￾building courses on new methods for specialists, \r\nand working with the International Organization for \r\nStandardization (ISO) on national standards regarding \r\nbuilding structures and materials. (SDG 11.1)\r\nConcrete is accepted as the main material in \r\nconstruction, as well as a material that may \r\nincrease environmental damage due to its high \r\nconsumption in the mining of minerals, energy, \r\nand polluting effects. The Standards Institution \r\nof Israel (SII) is leading the initiative on the \r\ndevelopment of Self Compacting Concrete and High \r\nPerformance and Ultra High Performance Concrete \r\nwithin the framework of the ISO. This initiative \r\naffects the construction life cycle (durability) in \r\na positive manner by decreasing material and \r\nenergy consumption to improve the sustainability \r\nspectrum. (SDG 11.c) In addition, a new initiative \r\nsupported by the SII and the Ministry of Economy \r\nand Industry encourages the active involvement \r\nof Israel’s industrialized sector in the ISO’s \r\ninternational standardization activity. \r\nIsrael is a member of the Global Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Criteria (GSDC) Initiative, committed \r\nto promoting sustainable communities worldwide. \r\nIn 2018, MASHAV, in cooperation with the Gender \r\nUnits of UN Habitat and the UN Environment \r\nProgram (UNEP), organized a capacity-building \r\ncourse in Israel on Building Sustainable \r\nCommunities: Leadership, Gender, and the \r\nEnvironment. Furthermore, a capacity-building \r\ncourse on Gender and Local Governance was \r\nconducted promoting basic urban services, \r\nland rights and housing, security, budgeting, \r\nenvironment, and confronting gender biases. \r\n(SDG 11.b, 5.5)\r\nResilient communities engender good governance, \r\ntransparency of government institutions and \r\npolicies, and stronger community services. \r\nIsrael works together with communities and civil \r\nsociety on developing skills to promote economic \r\ngrowth, resilience in the face of mass casualty \r\nevents, reinforcing social support systems for \r\nthe protection of women and children, ensuring \r\nsafety by engaging in community policing, and \r\ndeveloping drug control strategies. While cities \r\ncommand an increasingly dominant role in the \r\nglobal economy, rapid urban growth throughout \r\nthe developing world is seriously outstripping the \r\ncapacity of most cities to provide adequate services. \r\nMASHAV’s programs reflect Israel’s commitment to \r\nstrengthening community resilience by enhancing \r\nthe capacities of women and men to contribute to \r\nthe development process. The programs empower \r\npeople to develop an integrated and comprehensive \r\napproach to address the challenges of urbanization, \r\nin accordance with the three pillars of sustainability \r\n– economic, social and environmental – while \r\nconfronting the massive increase in the numbers \r\nof urban poor. \r\nFollowing is a description of some of the programs: \r\n(SDG 11.3, 11.a)\r\n• In alignment with the findings of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation in Europe (OECD, \r\nStudies on Water and Cities, 2015), “cities can only \r\ndevelop sustainably when they provide a reliable \r\nwater supply and sanitation services...” MASHAV \r\nconducts two annual capacity-building courses: \r\nUrban Water Technologies and Management, \r\nfocusing on the critical importance of access \r\nto water as a defining factor in the location, \r\nprosperity and resilience of cities, and providing \r\ntools to develop a comprehensive approach to \r\nurban water management; and a capacity-building \r\ncourse on Addressing the Urbanization Challenge.\r\n• Individual and social activism contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of an inclusive and safe society \r\nand foster a spirit of volunteerism. Citizen \n\n217\r\nGOAL 11\r\nmobilization encourages action for the betterment \r\nof societies, an alertness to the needs of the \r\ncommunity, spearheading of new legislation \r\nby means of feedback to decision-makers, and \r\npressuring for reform. The direct relationship \r\nbetween the strength of a community and \r\nsolving the problems of its individual members \r\nprovides the context for MASHAV’s Leadership \r\nfor Civil Social Activism training course aimed at \r\nequipping community leaders with the skills to \r\nbuild and strengthen their civil society through the \r\nmobilization of human and material resources.\r\n• Municipal Projects for Civil Security is a capacity￾building course conducted in Spanish for mayors, \r\npolice officers and relevant municipal and national \r\nofficials from Latin America. Civil security is one \r\nof the largest problems facing municipalities, \r\nand decentralization processes have led local \r\ngovernments to assume responsibility for areas \r\nusually covered by the central government. The \r\ncourse relates to the municipal government \r\nsystem in Israel as a regulator and coordinator of \r\ncivil security programs such as the City without \r\nViolence integrative model. Follow-up seminars \r\nwere carried out in Peru and Guatemala.\r\n• The Police and Community Training Course \r\nfocuses on approaches to connect the police \r\nforce with the community on matters relating \r\nto crime prevention, particularly among youth. \r\nCourses are conducted in English and Spanish. \r\nFollow-up seminars were subsequently carried \r\nout in El Salvador and Honduras.\r\nIn this context, a move to promote awareness \r\nand implementation of the SDGs in cities and \r\nmunicipalities throughout Israel was taken (2018) \r\nby the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya, \r\nwhich introduced the first Smart and Sustainable \r\nCity Index (SSCI) Survey. The Survey measured \r\nthe performance of Israeli cities in line with the \r\nSDGs and rated them accordingly. The Index offers \r\ngoals and key directions for instituting strategies \r\nfor sustainability in cities to help prepare for the \r\nchallenges involved in the growing complexity of \r\nurban life as a result of global processes – climate \r\nchange, migration, and intense economic changes – \r\nwhile taking advantage of the ubiquity of technology. \r\nIsrael is in the process of sharing the SSCI as a tool \r\nwith relevant specialized UN agencies. (SDG 11.3)\r\nIsrael is implementing the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted at the \r\nWorld Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, and \r\nis active in the UN Office for Disaster Reduction \r\n(UNISDR). As it approaches 2030, Israel will increase \r\nits international development programming to \r\nenhance partner country preparedness as well \r\nas crisis management in emergency and mass \r\ncasualty situations. At the 72nd UN General \r\nAssembly, Israel cosponsored a Draft Resolution \r\non International Cooperation on Humanitarian \r\nAssistance in the Field of Natural Disasters, from \r\nRelief to Development. (SDG 11.b)\r\nIsrael currently supports four of its experts on \r\nthe roster of the UN Disaster Assessment and \r\nCoordination (UNDAC), and a representative of \r\nIsrael’s National Emergency Authority (NEMA) \r\nserves on its Board. (SDG 11.b)\r\nThe establishment of Israel’s Meteorological Service \r\n(IMS) was due to a large extent to successful \r\ncollaboration with the World Meteorological \r\nOrganization (WMO). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs \r\nand Ministry of Transport commemorated (2018) the \r\n80th anniversary of the IMS in the presence of the \r\nSecretary General of the WMO and Head of Cabinet. \r\nThe event also launched Israel’s membership in \r\nthe Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) \r\nand the opening of the COSMO General Meeting \r\nin Jerusalem. Furthermore, COSMO developed a \r\nRegional Numerical Weather Prediction Model, \r\nand the software is shared with colleagues from \r\nthe developing world. (SDG 11.b)\r\nEach year severe hydro-meteorological events \r\naround the world give rise to multiple casualties and \r\nsignificant damage to property and infrastructure, \r\nwith adverse economic consequences for \r\ncommunities, and especially vulnerable populations. \r\nMany of these tragic events can be forecasted \r\nand accurate warning information disseminated \r\nin a timely fashion by the responsible national \r\nmeteorological and hydrological services (NMHS). \r\nOften, there is a lack of communication between \r\nthe NMHS and emergency authorities. MASHAV, \n\n218\r\nSustainable Cities and Communities\r\nIMS, NEMA, the Finnish Meteorological Institute \r\n(FMI) and the Meteorological Office of the United \r\nKingdom conduct an annual institutional capacity￾building course for professionals from developing \r\nand least developing countries on Meteorological \r\nWarnings and Emergency Response to Hazardous \r\nWeather Events. (SDG 11.5)\r\nIn line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030 (SDG 11.b), additional \r\nactivities conducted include:\r\n• Emergency Situation Preparedness is a \r\ncapacity-building course conducted in Israel by \r\nMASHAV, the International Institute of Leadership \r\n(Histadrut) and NEMA, in both English and \r\nSpanish for professionals from Africa, Asia and \r\nLatin America. The main goal of the course is \r\nto assist authorities in formulating a National \r\nand Regional Response Plan to Crises while \r\nmaintaining political, economic, and social \r\nstability. Israeli experts conducted follow-up \r\ncourses in South East Asia (Myanmar), Africa \r\n(Nigeria, Kenya,) and Latin America (Colombia, \r\nArgentina) in cooperation with local partners; \r\n• In cooperation with Rambam Hospital, MASHAV \r\nholds two international capacity-building courses \r\nin Israel on Decision Making in Emergencies \r\nand Mass Casualty Events involving multi￾stakeholders and Developing and Organizing \r\na Trauma System in Mass Casualty Situations.\r\nIsrael recognizes the critical importance of regional \r\ncooperation in tackling adverse environmental \r\nimpacts on cities and human settlements to \r\npromote resilience to disasters and develop the \r\nnecessary tools to implement early disaster warning \r\nsystems. Israel is a member of the WMO initiative, \r\nsupported by USAID, on the Black Sea and Middle \r\nEast Flash Flood Guidance System (BSMEFFGS), a \r\nregional initiative aimed at enhancing capabilities \r\nto issue timely predictions and warnings of flash \r\nflood events. Within the scope of the initiative, a \r\nseries of training activities took place in Israel, \r\nincluding an operational workshop, under the \r\nauspices of the IMS, with the participation of \r\nprofessionals from the Palestinian Meteorological \r\nDepartment in Ramallah. Additional examples of \r\nregional cooperation include: (SDG 11.b)\r\n• The IMS participates in the regional WMO and USAID \r\ninitiative entitled South East Europe Multi-Hazard \r\nEarly Warning Advisory System (SEE-MHEWS) to \r\nconstruct severe weather warning mechanisms \r\nto support Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in many \r\ndeveloping countries. Israel is a member of the \r\nProject’s Policy Advisory Group (PPAG), and its \r\nexperts participate in different working groups. \r\nIsrael is set to host the next SEE-MHEWS Project \r\nSteering Committee meeting in 2019;\r\n• NEMA, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority \r\nare working together with the UN Office for \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \r\nin Geneva on improving regional preparedness \r\nin the field of emergency management. This \r\ncooperation includes setting up a regional early \r\nwarning system in case of earthquakes and \r\ncreating a regional coordination center in case \r\nof natural disasters. Two disaster prevention \r\nexercises were conducted in the region: a \r\nEuropean-Mediterranean exercise in Israel and \r\nJordan on preventing forest fires and an exercise \r\nin Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority \r\non earthquakes and extending international \r\nassistance in emergency situations; \r\n• OCHA/Geneva certified Israel’s National Search \r\nand Rescue Unit (NRU) as an International Search \r\nand Rescue Group (INSARAG). This allows Israel \r\nto enhance its collaboration with other search \r\nand rescue teams in serving the international \r\ncommunity in response to emergency situations. \r\nIn 2019, an Israel Defense Forces aid delegation \r\narrived in the area of the collapsed dam in Brazil, \r\nmaking it the first National Search and Rescue \r\nUnit dispatched after INSARAG qualification.\r\nWithin the framework of the OECD, Israel is a \r\nmember of the International Transport Forum, \r\nsupporting the promotion of sustainable transport \r\nthat is safe, clean and competitive. In addition, \r\nIsrael assumes an active role in the UN Economic \r\nCommission for Europe (UNECE) Committee on Rail \r\nTransport, and its representative was re-elected to \r\nthe position of Vice Chair of the Working Party on Rail \r\nTransport that provides a pan-European forum for \r\nexchange of technical, legal and policy information. \r\nIsrael is also active in the OECD International \r\nTraffic Safety Data and Analysis Group, and the ITF \r\n– International Transport Forum.

In 2018/19, 40 per cent of \r\nhouses were considered to be safe, above \r\nthe target of ensuring 37.9 per cent saf￾er houses in 2019. Household units with \r\nthatched/straw roofs was 9.1 per cent in \r\n2016/17, an improvement from 19 per cent \r\nin 2015. The population of people living \r\nin slums in the year 2016/17 decreased to \r\n200,000 from 2015’s fgure of 500,000. Sim￾ilarly the percentage of households with \r\nfve or more persons decreased from 46.7 \r\nper cent in 2015 to 43.6 per cent in 2019. The \r\ngovernment is planning to develop 27 new \r\ncities in the coming years. \r\nThe private sector is also involved in urban \r\nreal estate. Because they started building \r\nresidential apartments and housing com￾plexes only of late, they are not enough and \r\nout of access to people in general. The de￾mand for safer houses also increased after \r\nthe 2015 earthquake destroyed thousands \r\nof houses, health facilities, schools, and cul￾tural and religious sites. \n\n48\r\nNEPAL: NATIONAL REVIEW OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\nAt the current pace, it will be diffcult to \r\nmeet the target of achieving 60 per cent \r\nsafer houses in 2030. This needs to be ac￾celerated. The government has developed \r\nand has been implementing a national ac￾tion plan on ending gender-based violence. \r\nMore efforts will be made and necessary \r\npolicies and programs will be intensifed to \r\nreduce such violence.\r\nSimilarly, in order to develop safe and re￾silient urban areas, a National Urban Poli￾cy was formulated in 2007. A new national \r\nurban development strategy was adopted \r\nin 2017 with a view to making the cities \r\nsustainable, and ensuring safe, adequate \r\nand affordable housing in the country. The \r\nNational Urban Development Strategy is in \r\nline with SDG 11 and the New Urban Agen￾da proposed under Habitat III. It looks at \r\nsocial, physical, and environmental dimen￾sions in a holistic manner, while taking into \r\naccount the proper land use policy and de￾velopment of a public transport system to \r\nserve such urban settlements.",

         "Voluntary National Review for the High Level Political Forum 2017 – Maldives, July 2017\r\n15\r\nGoal 12 – Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\r\nDespite the high dependence on imported food, agriculture constitutes an important sector for \r\nboth livelihood and food security. However, reliance on chemical fertilizers, insecticides and \r\npesticides remain a concern in the agricultural sector. In addition to this, amongst other factors, \r\ninadequate storage and transportation results in a significant amount of food waste. Interventions \r\nto promote sustainable consumption and production in agricultural sector would need to focus on \r\nthese challenges and issues. Furthermore, a sound management of waste remains a significant \r\nchallenge, particularly given the dispersed population. Addressing this issue will be critical to \r\nsubstantively realize the goal on sustainable consumption and production. \r\nFishing constitutes as one of the most important sectors for the country’s economy. The pole and \r\nline fishing method practiced in the Maldives for centuries is a model for sustainable fisheries, the \r\ncleanest and the greenest, whereby each fish is caught individually to reduce by-catch. Yellow fin \r\ntuna is the second largest catch in the Indian Ocean and the latest stock assessments show \r\noverfishing of this species mainly due to increasing fisheries activity in the Indian Ocean by all \r\ncountries. However, interim measures have been taken by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission \r\n(IOTC) to recover the stocks by introducing catch limits, reduction of drifting Fish Aggregating \r\nDevices and reduction of supply vessels.\r\nThe tourism sector in the Maldives serves as a model for sustainable tourism. From its very early \r\nstages of development, environmental considerations had been integrated to the sector through \r\nrelevant laws and regulations. The private sector has also been critical in adopting sustainable \r\nconsumption and production principles in the tourism sector.",

         "SDG 12: \r\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\r\nConsumption and production activities are the basis of the global economy, but unsustainable \r\nconsumption and production patterns are a major cause of climate change, land degradation, \r\nresource depletion, and air and water pollution. Tus, the inclusion of Goal 12 within the \r\nSustainable Development Goals is a recognition of the fundamental and comprehensive role of \r\nsustainable consumption and production in sustainable development, to improve human well￾being, including the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development, \r\nand to respond to the challenge of the earth carrying capacity to meet the growing needs of the \r\npopulation and increasing rate of urbanization that result in intensive use of resources. SDG12 \r\nincludes 11 targets and 13 indicators, in addition to other cross-cutting targets with other SDGs that \r\nfocus on food, education, water, energy, economy, cities, oceans and economic development. Tere \r\nare an estimated 22 targets and 28 indicators related to sustainable consumption and production \r\nwithin the framework of the SDGs.1\r\nSustainable consumption and production refer to doing more in a better quality while minimizing \r\nthe use of natural resources and toxic materials, as well as reducing the emissions of waste \r\nand pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of \r\nfuture generations. In order to implement sustainable consumption and production, the 10-\r\nYear Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) \r\nwas adopted at the Rio+20 Conference. Te 10YFP is a global framework for action to enhance \r\ninternational cooperation and accelerate the shif towards sustainable consumption and \r\nproduction (SCP) patterns in both developed and developing countries.2\r\n SDG 12 covers:\r\n• Te need for policies for SCP is underlined through the implementation of the 10-Year Framework \r\nof Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) (target 12.1) \r\n• Sustainable management and efcient use of natural resources.

As for the indicators (12.4.2; 12.6.1; 12.7.1; 12.b.1), the available \r\ndata until 2019 showed that they are in the right direction to achieve the targeted values. As for the \r\nindicator 12.3.1, data indicated that the trend of the progress was swinging, while data were not \r\navailable on four indicators, namely (12.2.1; 12.2.2; 12.a.1; 12.c.1)4\r\n(4) https://hukoomi.gov.qa/ar/about-qatar/sustainable-development-goals#Responsible-Consumption\r\nQATAR VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 2021 105\n\nFigure (12.1) SDG 12 Indicators Dashboard\r\n12.1.1 12.2.1 12.2.2 12.3.1 12.4.1 12.4.2 12.5.1\r\nDecreasing On Track Alternating No data available Measures adapted\r\n12.6.1 12.7.1 12.8.1 12.a.1 12.b.1 12.c.1\r\nSource: Planing and Statistics Authority - Sustainable Development Indicators Report 2019\r\nSteps Forward\r\nSDG 12 occupies a special place in the State of Qatar due to the peculiarity of the production base in \r\nthe Qatari economy, as the oil sector still accounts for approximately 49% of the GDP, about 89% of \r\ntotal merchandise exports, and about 94% of the state’s total revenue. In this context, Chapter One \r\nof the Second National Development Strategy has been to develop the economic infrastructure \r\nand encourage private investment by providing appropriate conditions and basic services for these \r\nsectors for growth, establishing industrial and service areas, supporting and developing small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises and increasing their contribution to the diversifcation of the production \r\nbase.5\r\n \r\nAt the same time, Qatar is striving to raise awareness of responsible consumption, which goes hand \r\nin hand with diversifcation of production to overcome the challenges it faces in terms of limited \r\nresources, rapid rate of population growth and the resulting large urbanization and the increase in \r\neconomic activities. In this regard, the “Tarsheed” campaign and program launched by the Qatar \r\nGeneral Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA), is a good example of sustainable awareness \r\nwork, which aims to promote a culture of consumption rationalization and responsible consumption, \r\nas the national program seeks to entrench it socially over time, in order to become an integral part \r\nof our lives, all the way towards building a balanced consumption pattern in Qatar. In this context, \r\nKAHRAMAA Awareness Park (KAP) was opened within the National Campaign for Global Citizenship \r\nand Sustainable Development Education. Te park includes several facilities such as a versatile \r\nhall to screen documentaries on energy rationalization, awareness-raising processes, and energy \r\nconservation simulation processes, as well as specialized tools to raise awareness of energy efciency \r\nand rationalization, among others. Tis year, the program launched a new national initiative aimed \r\nat reducing electricity and water consumption in the residential sector by 5%.6\r\nTe Second National Development Strategy 2018-2022 includes many goals and initiatives that \r\npromote the achievement of SDG 12 to ensure sustainable production and consumption patterns, \r\nespecially in the areas of food, energy, water and waste management. In the area of food security, \r\n(5) KAHRAMAA\r\n(6) NDS-2 (2018-2022) + KAHRAMMA \r\nQATAR VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 2021 106\n\nthe strategy aims to develop an integrated plan for agricultural services by 2022, which includes \r\nincreasing the self-sufciency ratio of fsh stocks to 65% and animal production to 30%. Te State \r\nof Qatar has made great achievements in the feld of food security and self-sufciency as a result \r\nof implementing many national strategic projects. In 2019, the State of Qatar was ranked frst \r\namong the Arab countries in terms of indicators for achieving food security, and globally it jumped \r\nfrom 22nd place in 2018 to 13th place in 2019, according to the World Food Security Index issued in \r\nDecember 2019.7\r\nFurthermore, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays an active role in facilitating timely \r\naccess to market information and strategic stocks of food to ensure that price fuctuation is \r\nreduced by using a national strategic inventory management and control system to manage and \r\ncontrol the strategic stock of food and consumer goods. Te electronic system aims at partnership \r\nbetween government and private sector such as the General Authority of Customs, suppliers \r\nand major outlets as well as local producers and manufacturers. Te national strategic inventory \r\nmanagement and control system is fexible and adaptable to various developments, emergency \r\ncircumstances, disasters and epidemics, such as COVID-19.8\r\nIn the feld of energy, the Second National Development Strategy aims to improve and increase the \r\nenergy efciency by 10% by 2022, as well as increase the production capacity of power stations and \r\nimprove the production and use of renewable energy to reach a production of 200 megawatts by \r\n2020 to be increased to 500 megawatts aferwards, and reduce the rate of per capita consumption \r\nof electricity by a percentage of 8%. In the feld of water consumption and management, NDS \r\naims to reduce the loss of drinking water rate to 8% by 2022, minimize groundwater depletion and \r\ndevelop the groundwater aquifer by 2020, provide infrastructure to use 70% of the TSE produced \r\nin diferent projects, and reduce per capita water consumption by 15%.10\r\nIn the feld of waste management, the solid waste management was classifed as one of grand \r\nchallenges for the State of Qatar being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, which \r\nresulted in high rates of population growth, urbanization, industrial growth, and economic \r\nexpansion. In this context, the State of Qatar adopted a comprehensive plan for solid waste \r\nmanagement and its recycling, which resulted in the establishment of the Domestic Solid Waste \r\nManagement Center located in Mesaieed, which is Middle East’s frst fully integrated Solid Waste \r\nManagement Facility. In 2020, the Center produced more than 30,000 tonnes of organic fertilizer \r\nand generated about 269 thousand megawatts/hour of electric power, and more than 33 million \r\ncubic meters of biogas, in addition to processing more than 30 thousand tonnes of car tires in each \r\nof the Umm Al Afai landfll and Rawdat Rashid landfll, as well as recycling about (420) thousand \r\ntonnes of construction waste. Qatar Petroleum has shipped approximately 1,500 barrels of \r\nNaturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) waste from Halul Island and 87 drums of NORM \r\nwaste from Ras Lafan to a specialist facility in the UK for processing and treatment. Te strategic \r\nplan of Qatar National Water and Electricity Company aims at recycling or reusing 100% of the \r\ngenerated waste.13 \r\nNDS-2 (2018-2022) aims at increasing the proportion of recycled materials in projects to 20% of the \r\ntotal materials used, recycling 15% of solid waste generated by the end of 2022, and keeping the \r\ndomestic waste generation rate under 1.6 kg per capita/day during the period 2018-2022.

Tis includes the efcient use of natural resources, \r\nand the use of sustainable solutions and technologies in the felds of energy, water, food and \r\nwaste, to leave a legacy and practical experience that stimulate environmental sustainability not \r\nonly in Qatar and the region, but also the entire world.\r\nIn the context of Qatar’s pledge to host one of the best environmentally friendly FIFA World Cup \r\n2022, the state of Qatar targets the most eco-friendly materials across the whole life cycle, starting \r\nwith adopting the principle of sustainable procurement, driven by the ethical sourcing of green \r\nbuilding materials, so as to maximize resource efciency and reduce emissions, waste and negative \r\nimpacts on human health and biodiversity. Tis includes giving priority to materials that are either \r\nfree of or having low toxic substances that may afect human health, materials with recycled \r\ncontents and of lower carbon emissions factor, and materials that can be reused or recycled during \r\nthe dismantling phase, and then during the construction phase where the target is waste recycling \r\nrather than landflling of construction and demolition waste. Terefore, in some projects the \r\nrecycling rate could reach 90%. Finally, in the events stage, the target of waste management plan \r\nis to reduce waste from the source, reuse and recycle the generated wastes.15\r\n(15) Sustainability Strategy for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\r\nQATAR VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 2021 108\n\nQatar Foundation \r\nQatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development works to fnd innovative \r\nsolutions and directs its eforts - through its research centers and educational institutions - to \r\nenhance ensuring sustainable production and consumption patterns based on scientifc research, \r\ndevelopment and innovation. It has established higher education programs into sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Hamad Bin Khalifa University focusing on energy and environment issues, and \r\nQatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI). Tis is in addition to launching initiatives \r\nthat instil the concept of sustainability in the community, such as establishing of Qatar Foundation \r\nNursery to produce vegetables; using the sludge from wastewater treatment plants as a natural \r\nfertilizer for aforestation in cooperation with Ashghal; desalination of water using solar energy; \r\nand adopting green cleaning practices using reusable microfbre cloths for cleaning to reduce \r\nlandfll waste.16\r\nShif Towards Green Buildings\r\nIn the context of promoting green development and in line with the role of Qatar National \r\nVision 2030 to transform Qatar from depleted natural resources based economy such as oil and \r\ngas to a knowledge-based economy, Qatar Green Building Council (QGBC), afliated to its Qatar \r\nFoundation, was established in 2009 to rally and involve all sectors, stakeholders and the local \r\ncommunity to support the green environmental issues and shif towards green buildings. Examples \r\nof green buildings initiatives include the Qatar National Convention Center, obtained the US Green \r\nBuilding Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) gold-certifcation, which \r\nwas designed in a way that takes into account the standards of sustainability and environmental \r\npreservation. Other examples include Msheireb City and Lusail City, where all buildings are eco￾friendly. Overall, Qatar ranks second in terms of the share of green and eco-friendly buildings in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa17.\r\n(16) Qatar Foundation \r\n(17) Qatar Green Building Council\r\nQATAR VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 2021 109\n\nChallenges \r\n• Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns in light of the increasing rate of \r\npopulation, which occurs simultaneously with the economic and construction boom that \r\nthe country is witnessing and the consequent increase in demand for natural resources and \r\neconomic activities.\r\n• Efective communication with stakeholders to provide information / data, build the credibility \r\nof the Sustainable Consumption and Production Program and ensure that stakeholders are \r\ncommitted to the implementation process.\r\n• How to measure the achieved progress in the absence of sufcient data, needed to measure \r\nthe indicators of SDG12 and to determine the baseline.\r\n• Being highly dependent on resources extraction, as Qatar has the world’s third largest natural \r\ngas reserves, it makes it even more difcult to decouple resource extraction from economic \r\ngrowth, especially when the global demand on natural resources is growing.\r\nOpportunities \r\n• Engaging the private sector, civil society organizations, fnancial institutions and other \r\nstakeholders in Qatar to contribute to the implementation of the goals and objectives related \r\nto sustainable consumption and production.\r\n• Enhancing the exchange of experiences with other countries and benefting from regional \r\nexperiences in integrating and implementing the goals and objectives related to sustainable \r\nconsumption and production, and as part of the framework of monitoring and following -up \r\non the implementation of Te 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n• Te use of a wide range of diferent communication mechanisms, such as seminars, workshops, \r\nbrochures, booklets, television, radio, web pages and databases, and the smart use of public \r\nmedia to reach out the vast majority of the society and raise awareness about the programs of \r\nsustainable consumption and production.\r\n• Strengthening capacities and knowledge on sustainable consumption and production across \r\nthe implementing agencies through training, guidance, research, application of tools of \r\nsustainable consumption and production policy, and issuance of relevant legislation.\r\n• Shifing from the linear economy model which traditionally follows the “take-make -use \r\n- dispose” approach, leading to the depletion of natural resources and the generation of \r\nwaste and emissions to the circular economy model that aims at eliminating waste and the \r\ncontinuous use of resources. Circular systems employ reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, re￾manufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimizing the use of resource \r\ninputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions.\r\nQATAR VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 2021 110",

         "38 BRISTOL AND THE SDGs A VOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW OF PROGRESS 2019\r\nSDG 13\r\nCLIMATE ACTION\r\nIn November 2018, Bristol City Council \r\nwas the first in the UK to declare a climate \r\nemergency and subsequently brought \r\nforward its stated aim of becoming carbon \r\nneutral from 2050 to 2030 (13.2). In April \r\n2019, the University of Bristol became \r\nthe first university in the UK to declare a \r\nclimate emergency. These declarations \r\nreflect broad-based concern in the city: the \r\npercentage of respondents to the Bristol \r\nQuality of Life Survey expressing concern \r\nabout climate change rose from 74% in \r\n2015 to 86% in 2018 (13.3). Moreover, \r\nthese concerns are largely consistent \r\nacross income brackets, in contrast to \r\nconventional wisdom. Even in the most \r\ndeprived communities, 4 out of 5 people \r\nexpress concern about climate change. \r\nBristolians are increasingly concerned \r\nabout how climate change will affect their \r\njobs, work, neighbourhoods, the weather \r\nand the economy. Over the past three \r\nyears, the proportion of respondents that \r\nhave changed their diet, household waste, \r\nenergy use and travel as a result of climate \r\nchange concerns has also increased (13.3). \r\nThere are signs of progress: per capita \r\nCO2 emissions fell between 2010-2016 \r\nfrom 6.44 tonnes per year per person to \r\n4.68. Furthermore, total emissions have \r\ndropped from 2230.9 k-tonnes (2010) \r\nto 1547 (2018). While these are positive \r\ntrends, the downward trajectory is not \r\nfast enough to achieve decarbonisation \r\nby 2030. Moreover, these figures only \r\naccount for Scope 1 emissions—i.e. \r\nemissions produced within Bristol’s \r\nadministrative boundaries. Yet the city \r\nimports a significant amount of energy, \r\ngoods and services produced outside its \r\nborders, and the emissions associated \r\nwith these imports (i.e. Scope 2 and \r\nScope 3 emissions) are unknown. To \r\nachieve true carbon neutrality, a collective \r\neffort will be required involving a wide \r\nrange of stakeholders, as well as central \r\ngovernment support.\r\nWHAT WE’RE DOING\r\nCarbon Neutrality (13.2) \r\nThe 2018 Bristol City Council motion to \r\ndeclare a climate emergency was passed \r\nunanimously. It called for the Mayor to \r\nmake a pledge to make Bristol carbon \r\nneutral by 2030 (Including scope 1, 2 \r\nand 3 emissions), work with central \r\ngovernment to provide the powers and \r\nresources to make this possible, and work \r\nnationally and internationally to determine \r\nand implement the best practice methods \r\nto limit Global warming to less that 1.5°C. \r\nOn March 5th 2019, nearly 200 city \r\nstakeholders gathered to discuss how to \r\naccelerate progress towards becoming a \r\ncarbon neutral city, and generated nearly \r\n600 ideas. Alongside this action, both \r\nuniversities are working in partnership \r\nwith the City Council sustainability team \r\nto provide research capabilities on how \r\nthe city can decarbonise and encourage \r\nbehaviour change. As part of the One \r\nCity approach a new Environmental \r\nSustainability Board has been established \r\nwhich will help support decarbonisation. \r\nIn April 2019, the University of Bristol \r\nbecame the first UK university to declare \r\na climate emergency and set a target of \r\ncarbon neutrality by 2030. \r\nEducation (13.1, 13.3)\r\nAt the March 2019 Carbon Neutrality \r\ncity gathering, many of the suggestions \r\nand responses made by participants \r\ncalled for greater engagement with \r\ncommunities and citizens of Bristol. There \r\nare already a lot of organisations working \r\nto improve education on the need for \r\nclimate action. We The Curious, an \r\nIn November 2018 Bristol \r\nCity Council declared a \r\nClimate Emergency, followed \r\na few months later by the \r\nUniversity of Bristol. These \r\ndeclarations reflect the \r\nconcerns of Bristol citizens \r\nmore widely. Per capita CO2 \r\nemissions have decreased \r\nsince 2010, as have \r\noverall emissions despite \r\npopulation growth.\r\nHowever, as a comparatively \r\nwealthy city, Bristol imports \r\na large volume of goods and \r\nservices for which associated \r\nemissions are unknown. \r\nMoreover, limited powers \r\nconstrain the ability of \r\nlocal government to realise \r\nambitions to decarbonise the \r\neconomy. A collective effort, \r\nincluding support from \r\ncentral government, will be \r\nrequired to achieve this goal.\n\n BRISTOL AND THE SDGs VOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW OF PROGRESS 2019 39\r\ninteractive science museum, is focusing \r\nits public programmes on climate change \r\nthrough shows, activities, experiments \r\nand artworks. The Global Goals Centre \r\nis planning to have one of its interactive \r\nscenarios focused entirely on climate \r\nchange. The Bristol Inter Faith Group have \r\nheld education events on care for the \r\nenvironment, and the Bristol area Quaker \r\nchapter have held events supporting \r\nSolar Aid, climate change and Tree Aid. \r\nEducation and awareness are also being \r\nimproved through street art images like \r\nthe one of Greta Thunberg, the teenage \r\nclimate activist, completed in mid-May. \r\nFinally, schools such as Ashton Park \r\nSchool are joining the Eco-schools club \r\nand getting involved in projects that help \r\ntackle climate change while educating the \r\nnext generation of change makers. \r\nConstruction and regulation (13.2)\r\nAPG Architecture use sustainable design \r\nprinciples and recognised standards in all \r\ntheir projects to ensure that sustainability \r\nis built into all their work. Bristol City \r\nCouncil also acts as a regulator for the \r\nEnvironmental Permitting, ensuring \r\nemissions from industrial processes are in \r\ncompliance with regulations.\r\nReducing Emissions (13.2) \r\nBusiness West help to run & resource \r\nthe Somerset Energy Innovation Centre \r\nbusiness support programs, which are \r\navailable to help develop low carbon \r\nbusinesses. Social enterprise Raised in \r\nBristol operate out of Easton Community \r\nCentre, which is solar powered and \r\nuses an underground thermal source for \r\nheating and hot water. SustainIT solutions \r\npurchase green electricity, use low energy \r\nelectrical equipment and lighting, and \r\nchoose sustainable transport where \r\navailable. Stride Treglown have upgraded \r\ntheir bulbs to maximise energy efficiency \r\nand moved to green energy providers with \r\n100% renewable tariffs where possible. \r\nSt Monica’s Trust are incorporating solar \r\npower into their recent developments and \r\ntender their electricity consumption to \r\nhave renewable energy. \r\nPhoto credits: Suzy Carden-Noad\n\n40 BRISTOL AND THE SDGs A VOLUNTARY LOCAL REVIEW OF PROGRESS 2019",

Climate changes in Kazakhstan, \r\ndue to its geographical location and vast territory, are \r\nheterogeneous both by territory and by seasons of the \r\nyear. As a result, these changes may have both negative \r\nand positive effects on the biophysical systems, \r\neconomic activity and social sphere of the country.\r\nAccording to experts, 75% of the territory of Kazakhstan \r\nis at high risk of natural disasters, such as landslides, \r\nmudslides, floods, extreme temperatures, earthquakes, \r\nforest and steppe fres.

This creates a threat of overflow of \r\nmountain rivers. On the other hand, warming leads to lack of water in lowland \r\nrivers. \r\nKazakhstan’s climate policy is based on two main components:\r\n- Countries’ policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to contribute \r\nto curbing global temperature growth within 1.5 degrees from pre￾industrial levels;\r\n- The policy of countries on adaptation to climate change to reduce \r\nthe negative impact of climate change on water, forests, biodiversity, \r\nagriculture, etc.\n\nASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN\r\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN 2022 153\r\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions\r\nIn 2016, Kazakhstan undertook a voluntary contribution to reduce greenhouse \r\ngas (GHG) emissions by 15% from 1990 levels until 2030. \r\nKazakhstan is one of the largest sources of GHG emissions in the world. \r\nThe intensity of greenhouse gas emissions in the country is 0.57 tons per \r\nUSD 1,000 GDP. \r\nKazakhstan is on the 11th place in the world ranking of countries in terms \r\nof carbon intensity of GDP by the end of 2018, is in the Top 15 countries in \r\nterms of CO2 emissions per capita.115 Thus, the carbon footprint of a resident \r\nof Kazakhstan is 14,360 tons of CO2 equivalent per year, when the global \r\naverage is 5 tons per inhabitant.116\r\nFigure 25 shows the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions in the republic \r\nfor 2010-2020. \r\nFigure 25.

Since 2018, emissions have been reduced to 351 million \r\ntons of CO2 equivalent in 2020. The largest contribution to the volume of \r\nCO2 emissions is made by energy, and coal from energy carriers; the share of \r\ncoal in the generation of emissions is increasing at an intensive pace. At the \r\nsame time, Kazakhstan has great potential to reduce its ecological footprint \r\nas a global source of emissions. There are 134 RES facilities with an installed \r\ncapacity of 2,010 MW in Kazakhstan: 40 WPP (684 MW); 49 SPP (1,038 MW); \r\n40 HPP (280 MW); 5 BPP (8 MW). By the end of 2021, the volume of electricity \r\nfrom RES amounted to 4.2 billion kWh or 3.69% of the total electricity, which \r\nis 30% more than in 2020. \r\nOver the past 6 years, the installed capacity of renewable energy facilities \r\nhas grown almost 11 times – from 178 MW in 2014 to 2,010 MW in 2021. \r\n59 RES projects with a capacity of 1,400 MW are planned to be commissioned \r\nby 2025. The transition from coal and oil to gas and renewable energy sources \r\nwill reduce GHG emissions. \r\nCurrently, the country has established work on state regulation of greenhouse \r\ngas emissions. The impact of the results of the COP-26 Climate Conference \r\nin Glasgow on the low-carbon development of Kazakhstan was assessed. \r\nMeasures to minimize them are being worked out, a conceptual vision for the \r\nfunctioning of a key element of the transition to carbon neutrality is defned. \r\nThe transition to carbon neutrality will require large-scale investments in new \r\nand state-of-the-art low-carbon and carbon-free technologies.\r\nAs part of the state regulation of GHG, a carbon budget has been developed \r\nfor the period 2022-2025 based on a reduction in carbon quotas by at least \r\n1.5% annually from the level of the carbon budget of the previous year.\r\nOne of the main instruments of the market mechanism for reducing GHG \r\nemissions and achieving commitments under the Paris Agreement is the \r\nemissions trading system (ETS). In order to improve the national ETS, work is \r\nunderway to bring Kazakhstan’s ETS closer to the ETS of the European Union. \r\nThe convergence of the two systems will allow Kazakhstan’s carbon market to \r\nenter the international market.\r\nAccording to the Environmental Code, large enterprises will implement the \r\nbest available technologies (BAT) within 10 years in accordance with the \r\nenvironmental effciency program. For this period, they will be exempt from \r\npayment for emissions. The transition to the BAT for existing enterprises will \r\nbe phased. \n\nASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN\r\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN 2022 155\r\nThe National Project “Green Kazakhstan” provides for measures to improve \r\nthe quality of atmospheric air with indicators for reducing emissions of \r\npollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources in large cities by \r\nindustrial enterprises up to 57%. It is also planned to increase the carbon \r\nabsorption potential by planting over 2 billion trees by 2025. \r\nIn 2021, GTC Green Technology Hub Ltd. (Hub) was established. The Hub \r\nis a subsidiary of the Center for Green Finance of the Astana International \r\nFinancial Center, created to support green and socially signifcant startups \r\nand support enterprises to achieve carbon neutrality in the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan and Central Asia. The hub is engaged in the development of \r\ngreen projects, provides services for technological and environmental audit of \r\nindustrial enterprises, organization of technology transfer fnancing and post￾technological support.\r\nClimate change adaptation measures\r\nAdaptation to climate change is considered as one of the key elements of \r\nthe policy to combat climate change in Kazakhstan. For the frst time, the \r\nlegislation introduced norms on adaptation to climate change in priority \r\nsectors: water resources, agriculture, forestry and disaster risk reduction. \r\nChapter 22 of the adopted Environmental Code is devoted to issues of public \r\nadministration in the feld of adaptation to climate change. The Rules for \r\nthe organization and implementation of the process of adaptation to climate \r\nchange have been approved.117 \r\nThe adaptation process includes 7 stages: vulnerability assessment, planning, \r\ndevelopment of measures, implementation of measures, monitoring of the \r\neffectiveness of measures, reporting and adjustment of measures.\r\nBased on the results of the vulnerability assessment, it will be possible to take \r\ninto account the impact of climate change in the development of strategic \r\nand policy documents, and to include the necessary measures of adaptation \r\nto climate change at the national and local levels.\r\n117 Approved by the Order of the Minister of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources of the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan dated June 2, 2021 No. 170 Rules for the organization and implementation of the process of \r\nadaptation to climate change https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/V2100022974\n\nASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN\r\n156 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN 2022\r\nThere are 925 potentially dangerous areas exposed to floods in the republic, \r\nof which 189 settlements are threatened by meltwater. Guided by the \r\nprovisions of the Sendai Program, Kazakhstan has revised the system of \r\nproviding anti-settlement and anti-landslide protection of settlements. The \r\nprovisions of the Sendai Program118 are concrete action plans to strengthen \r\nthe adaptive capabilities of countries, increase resilience and reduce disaster \r\nrisk in the face of climate change. The Ministry of Emergency Situations of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, together with the UN Offce for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction, is developing a database for accounting for losses from natural \r\ndisasters of Desinventar Sendai. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan needs assistance \r\nin introducing information received online using space technologies into the \r\nactivities of predictive, emergency and rescue services. \r\nKazakhstan demonstrates its interest in actively participating in adaptation \r\nto global climate change. Successful adaptation to global climate change \r\ndepends not only on public policy, but also on the active, continuous \r\ninvolvement of other participants in this process, including national, regional, \r\ninternational organizations, representatives of the public and private sectors, \r\nand civil society.\r\n118 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction for 2015-2030 https://www.unisdr.org/fles/43291_rus\r\nsiansendaiframeworkfordisasterri.pdf\n\nASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN\r\nVOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN 2022 157\r\nNext steps on the SDG 13 implementation:\r\n Cooperation with international organizations on low-carbon \r\ndevelopment of Kazakhstan and the national climate adaptation \r\nplan.

Lake Sevan’s translucence is also reported as \r\nimproved. For 2012-14, the translucence has been 8.5 \r\nmeters, 11.5 meters, and 11 meters respectively. By \r\n2012, wastewater treatment plants were built for Gavar, \r\nMartuni, and Vardenis municipalities, all upstream from \r\nLake Sevan.\r\n Armenia is a landlocked country with no access to the \r\nsea but has a number of lakes the largest one being Lake \r\nSevan. Lake Sevan is the most important water ecosys￾tem in Armenia. Due to intensive use of the lake for many \r\nyears, the water level of the lake dropped by 20.2 m from \r\nnatural level (as of 2002), and the volume reduced by \r\nmore than 42%, leading to significant changes in the \r\nthermal regime and ecosystem of the lake. \r\n The protection of the Lake Sevan ecosystem is regu￾lated by law64. According to the law, the level of Lake \r\nSevan shall be increased from 2003 to 2030 at a rate of \r\n21.6 cm per year. The elevation of the lake was cited as \r\n1896.66 m at the end of 2001. This target has already \r\nbeen achieved (figure 30).\r\n One of the issues linked to increasing the level of the \r\nwater in the lake is related to changes in the ecosystem. \r\nSince 2001, the water level of the lake has risen by 4.1 \r\nm, again leading to a number of changes in the lake \r\necosystem.

Its goals include reducing toxic substances, \r\nmarine litter and microplastics to acceptable levels. Alongside \r\nits national strategy, the Netherlands supports the European \r\nConvention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of \r\nthe North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention), the UNEP Global \r\nPartnership on Marine Litter, and other European and global \r\nefforts to reduce litter in the oceans. The Natura 2000 sites to \r\nbe created in the North Sea occupy 19% of the Netherlands’ \r\nExclusive Economic Zone: 10,260 km², or over a million hectares.\r\nIn the Caribbean part of the Kingdom, a commission for marine \r\nbiodiversity and fsheries is responsible for the management of \r\nthe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the islands. Currently \r\nSaba, St Eustatius, Bonaire, Curaçao and the European part of \r\nthe Netherlands are represented in the commission. Aruba and \r\nSt Maarten are expected to join by 2020. In 2012, in consultation \r\nwith Saba, sustainable management began of the Saba Bank \r\n(2,400 km2), ensuring sustainable fsheries and marine biodi￾versity. \r\nThe Caribbean Netherlands has established the Yarari marine \r\nmammal and shark sanctuary in the waters around Bonaire \r\nand Saba. These waters are also protected as national marine \r\nparks. Together the national marine parks and the Saba Bank \r\nprogramme ensure the protection of 11% of all Caribbean \r\nNetherlands waters. The report Natuurambitie Grote Wateren \r\n2050-2100 (‘Goals for the Natural Protection of Major Bodies of \r\nWater’) outlined a national vision on the sustainable management \r\nof the Netherlands’ major bodies of water. \r\nAruba is proud of its beaches and its clean sea, as virtually all \r\nwastewater is treated before being discharged into the sea. The \r\ncountry recognises the ecological importance of marine life and \r\nthe need for responsible management of species by protecting \r\nand preserving the marine environment, wildlife and the coral \r\nreef.\r\nThe reefs that line Curaçao’s coast are in relatively good \r\ncondition, though under threat from the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change and pollution as elsewhere in the Caribbean. \r\nTwo Ramsar sites now surround the island to protect its reefs \r\nand marine environment. The waters around Curaçao have \r\nextensive coral reef systems, which are an international focal \r\npoint for marine biology research. The Caribbean Research and \r\nManagement of Biodiversity foundation conducts studies in the \r\nregion in cooperation with international institutes, promoting \r\nscientifc tourism. More than 300 researchers visit Curaçao every \r\nyear to study its unique ecosystems, including one of the three \r\ncoral reefs in the world that are still growing. The country hosts \r\nthe Smithsonian Institute’s Deep Reef Observation Project and \r\nSubstation Curaçao, and is home to the oldest marine biology \r\ninstitute in the Caribbean. In 2016, collaboration among marine \r\npartners resulted in the discovery of several new species of \r\nmarine fora and fauna. At the UN Ocean Conference in June \r\n2017, the government of Curaçao made two voluntary commit￾ments for the further development of marine research, involving \r\nan investment of about $5 million over three years. It also \r\ncommitted to codifying a sustainable ocean policy by the end \r\nof 2018. These commitments will help protect the waters around \r\nthe island. \r\nSt Maarten fnancially supports the Nature Foundation, in \r\norder to signifcantly reduce marine pollution and sustainably \r\nmanage and protect the island’s marine and coastal ecosystems. \r\nAs a board member of the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance \r\n(DCNA), the Foundation protects coral reefs and combats \r\nnatural habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Since 2016, St \r\nMaarten’s Mullet Pond has been listed as a protected Ramsar \r\nsite. St Maarten adheres to the Protocol Concerning Specially \r\nProtected Areas and Wildlife (the SPAW Protocol).\r\nAbroad\r\nThrough its national knowledge and innovation programme on \r\nwater and climate, the Netherlands aims to minimise the impact \r\nof ocean acidifcation by increasing scientifc knowledge of the \r\nphenomenon. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions seems to be \r\nthe most effective approach in the long run. Implementing the \r\nParis Agreement will contribute to that goal. \r\nThe Netherlands is also helping to restore the natural absorption \r\ncapacity of the seas and oceans, for instance through projects \r\nin Bangladesh. In the UN negotiations on biodiversity beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction (BBNJ), we advocate the protection of \r\nbiodiversity in marine areas through legally binding agree￾ments, compulsory Environmental Impact Assessments prior \n\n32 KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS – REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\r\nto new activities on the high seas, and effective international \r\nagreements on a fair and honest way of sharing the benefts \r\nof exploitation of marine genetic resources. In addition, the \r\nNetherlands supports technological innovation to increase food \r\nproduction from the sea and enhance climate resilience. \r\nThe researchers did a double take. Was it really a great \r\nhammerhead shark? The ones that normally live in the Atlantic \r\nOcean? Yes it was. And it was an intact specimen about 3.5 \r\nmetres long! They managed to catch it, took some DNA and \r\nthen released it.\r\nThe special catch, in March of this year, was part of an ongoing \r\nmonitoring programme by the St Maarten Nature Foundation. \r\nThe NGO’s researchers regularly sail out to examine the shark \r\npopulation. They organise monitoring dives, do fsh counts, \r\ncollect DNA and tag sharks, all to examine the development of \r\nthe species.\r\nSometimes Tadzio Bervoets, the director of the foundation and \r\nthe Save Our Sharks Project, is among the divers. ‘I personally \r\nattach great importance to the presence and management of \r\nsharks,’ he says. The Nature Foundation manages the Dutch \r\nCaribbean’s newest protected area, the Man of War Shoal \r\nMarine Park, which includes St Maarten’s most important reefs \r\nand provides a safe haven for sharks. \r\nAt the beginning of June, the foundation organised Shark Week \r\non St Maarten. It included children’s activities like a shark game \r\nand shark face painting, as well as scuba diving ‘to count our \r\nfriendly sharks and participate in the Kingdom Shark Count’. The \r\nkey message was that, as top predators, sharks play a crucial role \r\nin maintaining a balanced and healthy aquatic ecosystem. They \r\nare our best friends, rather than our enemies. But unfortunately, \r\nsharks are victims of poaching, fnning and overfshing, including \r\nin the waters around St Maarten. Shark meat is being sold in \r\nsupermarkets on the French part of the island.\r\nThe Nature Foundation is working hard to try and change the \r\nimage of sharks as man-eating monsters. Sharks occasionally \r\nbite when they feel threatened. But no unprovoked attack has \r\never been recorded on St Maarten. ‘It’s more likely that you’ll be \r\nkilled by a falling coconut than by a shark,’ says the foundation’s \r\nMelanie Meijer Zu-Schlochtern.\r\nSharks – and biodiversity in general – are also high on the \r\ngovernment of St Maarten’s agenda. In 2011 it issued a \r\ntemporary moratorium on shark fshing. It prohibited the taking \r\nof sharks and required any sharks caught by accident to be \r\nreleased immediately. Those who breached the rules risked a \r\npenalty of 500,000 Antillean guilders or three months in prison. \r\nIn 2016 the moratorium was replaced by a permanent ban. All \r\nthe waters surrounding St Maarten are now a shark sanctuary.\r\nSharks are not the only animals the Nature Foundation wants to \r\nprotect. The NGO, established in 1997, also actively manages \r\nSt Maarten’s sea turtle population. It is currently conducting a \r\nMarine Mammal Monitoring Project, as well as fghting dump \r\nfres and trying to prevent the coral around the island from \r\nbleaching. This year, director Tadzio Bervoets won a prize for \r\nhis work: the Euan McFarlane Environmental Leadership Award, \r\nissued by the Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands. He \r\nwas praised, among other things, for his tireless work to protect \r\nthe island’s sharks.\r\nAs a Regional Authorising Offcer for the 11th EDF Regional \r\nProgramme, St Maarten takes responsibility for enhancing \r\nmarine biodiversity and promoting sustainable energy. It is \r\nmanaging a cross-boundary nature park jointly with other \r\ngovernments in the region. \r\nText box 3 Great hammerhead shark shows up near St Maarten",

There has been a gradual improvement in the proportion of forest area to the total land area \r\nbetween 2015 and 2020 (Figure 12). The proportion of forest area to total land increased by 0.37% between 2015 and \r\n2020. Much of this progress is due to efforts by the government with the assistance of its partners that have resulted \r\nin various initiatives such as community education programmes on the importance of growing trees. It is important \r\nto note that although tree-planted forest area would be higher in terms of acreage, the survival rate is low for some \r\nreasons. This is why there is a gradual improvement in forest area as a proportion of the total land area.\r\nFigure 12:. Forest Areas as a Proportion of Total Land Area\r\nSource: Ministry of Forestry, Range and Soil Conservation (Field Data, 2022); FAO, Global Forest Resource \r\nAssessment, 2020\r\nNote: The figure shows a pre-baseline and post-baseline trend of forest area as a proportion of the total land area of \r\nLesotho. The indicator is defined as all land bearing a vegetative association dominated by trees of any size, \r\nexploitable or not; including all alpine, medium-altitude forests, wetland and riparian forests, plantations, and trees, \r\nwhether on land held in trust by the government (gazetted Forest Reserves, National Parks and Wildlife Reserves) or \r\nnon-gazetted land (leasehold, freehold or customary lands). It is calculated as Forest area (reference year) / Land area \r\n(2015) * 100\r\n1.4 1.44\r\n1.63\r\n2.52\r\n0\r\n0.5\r\n1\r\n1.5\r\n2\r\n2.5\r\n3\r\n2005 2010 2015 2020\n\nPage 52 of 77\r\nIndicator 15.1.2: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by \r\nprotected areas, by ecosystem type\r\nLesotho’s achievement on this indicator has increased, largely driven by the government's efforts to expand protected \r\nareas. Official statistics indicate that the area under protection has not changed since SDGs Baseline Survey in 2016. \r\nData from the BoS (2019) suggests that the total area under formal protection is only 13817.5 hectares which is merely \r\n0.48% of the country’s surface area. In addition to these designated protected areas, several areas such as Letseng￾La-Letsie Nature Reserve and Tsetse are either informally designated or proposed for protection in various parts of \r\nthe country. There has not been encroachment on the area covered under protected areas by other land-use activities \r\n(See Table 4). The government has already identified and informally designated new areas to expand protected areas. \r\nSome cultural and heritage sites also serve as protected areas conserving biodiversity. These include Thaba-Bosiu, \r\nMasitise, Ha Baroana, Menkhoaneng and Butha-Buthe Plateau.\r\nTable 4: Proportion of Important Sites for Terrestrial Biodiversity that are Covered by Protected Areas\r\nLiphofung\r\nNational \r\nMonument \r\nand \r\nReserve\r\nBokong \r\nNature \r\nReserve\r\n‘Muela \r\nNature \r\nReserve\r\nNational \r\nUniversity \r\nof Lesotho \r\n(botanical \r\ngarden)\r\nTšehlanyane \r\nNational \r\nPark\r\nSehlabathebe \r\nNational Park\r\nMasitise \r\nnature \r\nreserve\r\nTotal Area \r\nof \r\nTerrestrial \r\nBiodiversity \r\nArea (Ha) 4 1972 45 1.5 5, 300 6, 475 20 13, 817.5\r\nProportion \r\n(%) 0.03%\r\n14.27\r\n%\r\n0.33% 0.01% 38.36% 46.86% 0.14% 100%\r\nSource: Lesotho Bureau of Statistics (2018)\r\nThe number and area under important sites for freshwater biodiversity under protection has not changed, but the \r\ncountry has made progress regarding expansions of these areas through identification and proposals to include new \r\nareas. The Ministry of Water through an integrated approach is leading the process of declaration of wetlands as \r\nprotected areas. The integrated approach would involve stakeholder mapping, meeting with relevant stakeholders, \r\nwetlands identification, local authorities and community awareness and mobilisation; site visits and ensure\r\nconcurrence from relevant Ministries.\r\nProjects such as ReNOKA also seek to support collective action to protect and restore land and water for the shared \r\nprosperity of the communities living and working within the Orange-Senqu River Basin. The project also seeks to \r\nreverse the increasing degradation of Lesotho’s wetlands which is a threat to the Orange-Senqu River.\r\nThe main challenges in the country’s efforts to conserve and protect wetlands include inadequate planning systems \r\nand instruments, imbalance in the distribution of costs and benefits of wetland conservation, policy conflicts and \n\nPage 53 of 77\r\ninstitutional weakness. High mountain wetlands continue to degrade due to uncontrolled livestock grazing and \r\ntrampling infrastructure development, siltation and erosion, encroachment by cultivation and overexploitation of \r\nresources hence their need for their declaration as protected areas to conserve and protect them.\r\nIndicator 15.2.1D: Planted Forest Area\r\nThe planted forest area has increased because of support from various projects that the Department of Forestry has \r\nreceived. The indicator shows steady growth in planted forest area when one compares the 2020 indicator value with \r\nthe 2015 baseline indicator value. Financial institutions such as Standard Lesotho Bank through their social \r\nresponsibility program buys trees every year and donate them to the Ministry for planting. There are also community \r\neducation initiatives that create awareness of the importance of tree growing and discouraging cutting down of trees. \r\nAlthough forest planted area is normally high the survival rate due to factors such as climate change and vandalism. \r\nThe Department of Forestry is in the process of working with its partners to establish strategies to increase the survival \r\nrate of grown trees.\r\nFigure 13: Planted Forest area (1000 ha) for Lesotho, Planted Forests \r\nNote: The figure shows a pre-baseline and post-baseline trend of planted forest area for Lesotho. Indicator definition: \r\nForest is predominantly composed of trees established through planting and or deliberate seeding.

The country losses 2 percent of its topsoil annually due to soil erosion25. An estimation of about 66 percent \r\nof households lives on degraded land in Lesotho26. Traditional herding culture and livelihood are under threat due to \r\nerosion in the catchment areas of Lesotho which are alarming. Main drivers of land degradation in Lesotho include \r\npoor agriculture and land management practices including animal overstocking, burning of rangelands, deforestation, \r\nincreasing population pressure, and climate change induced impacts such as recurrent droughts and flooding.\r\nUN agencies such as UNDP and FAO have supported GoL in reversing land degradation through contributing towards \r\nrehabilitation of degraded land. The European Union and GIZ are among the donor organisations working with The \r\nGovernment of Lesotho in efforts to contain land degradation. Lesotho also has a dedicated ministry responsible for \r\nrange and soil conservation. ReNOKA ‘We are a river’ is a national programme and active citizen movement to \r\nadvance integrated catchment management in Lesotho and the Orange-Senqu River basin. The programme has \r\nidentified six (6) priority sub-catchments in Lesotho severely degraded and in need of urgent rehabilitation \r\n(ReNOKA,2021).\r\nIndicator 15.5.1D: Number of Local Species in Red List Categories\r\nThere is some positive progress made on this indicator since the last report in 2016. The country had only one \r\nanimal species listed in the IUCN Red List index that is the Lesotho Meadow Katydid, according to the SDGs \r\nIndicator Baseline Report 2016. Since that last report, Lesotho has a few other species that are now on this list. These \r\ninclude a bird species bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), aquatic (fish species) Maloti minnow (Pseudobarbus \r\nquathlambae) and a plant species, Spiral Aloe (Aloe polyphylla). The Department of Environment will see to it that \r\nthese endangered species receive protection.\r\nThe GoL is implementing some programmes and activities with the aim of conserving the status of these threatened \r\nspecies in order to increase their population. Although there is currently no systematic monitoring, there are \r\nindications that population sizes of some species (for example Spiral Aloe) have increased following conservation \r\nand protection interventions (Lesotho National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, \r\n2020).\r\n24 http://www.fao.org/family-farming/countries/lso/en\r\n25 World Bank (2016)\r\n26 United Nations Development Assistance Framework for Lesotho 2019-2023\n\nPage 55 of 77\r\nIndicator 15.8.1D: Existence of relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of \r\ninvasive alien species\r\nAccording to the SDGs Indicator Baseline Report 2016, relevant national legislation did not exist. In 2022, the \r\nNational Range Resources Management Act was presented to Parliament for enactment. This legislation will assist \r\nthe country in its progress by providing relevant legislation as a platform for stakeholders to ensure the prevention or \r\ncontrol of invasive alien species. \r\nBesides progress made regarding legislation, there has been significant progress in bush control (removal of invasive \r\nalien species) and reseeding of rangelands. The Reducing Vulnerability from Climate Change (RVCC) is an ongoing \r\nproject supported by UNDP whose commencement was January 2015, and it is expected to phase out in December \r\n2022. RVCC has been instrumental in the removal of invasive species in projects areas that covered 20 000 ha. Part \r\nof the interventions of the RVCC project in this reporting period include reseeding of rangelands especially after \r\nremoval of invasive species.\r\nBox 5. U-Report poll on Goal 15\r\nA summary of U-Report findings on SDG 15. \r\nMore than half of the youth (56.9%) had answered that “our environment” is the biggest priority for \r\nLesotho and only 2.6% had said that it is not very important for Lesotho. 56.9% had answered that “our \r\nenvironment” is the biggest priority for Lesotho and only 2.6% had said that it is not very important for \r\nLesotho. For the most pressing environmental issues in Lesotho, more than half (53.5%) of those \r\nanswered thinks that soil erosion and “lengope” is the most pressing issue in Lesotho. In addition to \r\ngeneral suggestions and calling out for more action by the government and cooperate, as compared to the \r\nother goals, many of the comments that were shared on this goal by the U-report youth, reflected the need \r\nfor a change in the individual perception or action. This included the need to change the people’s mind \r\nand educate citizens about the importance of environmental protection, proper grazing and improving \r\nrecycling.\r\nSources: UNICEF Lesotho Country Office\n\nPage 56 of 77\r\n5.4.2 Key Initiatives\r\n• There are ongoing community education programmes on the importance of growing of trees by the \r\ngovernment through support from development partners. The Government of Lesotho also receives \r\nsupport from various projects which has intensified tree planting while discouraging cutting down of \r\ntrees and promotes sustainable land use and management, agroforestry and afforestation.\r\n• Lesotho has developed Land Cover Atlas (2017) which provides statistics on hectares of trees, shrubs \r\nand grassland. This has enabled decision-making on land use planning and rehabilitation. \r\n• ReNoka represents a strategic vision for Lesotho in implementing the Lesotho Integrated Catchment \r\nManagement programme which is a multi-stakeholder process promoting integrated, sustainable and \r\nrisk-informed development and management of water, land and related resources.\r\n5.4.3 Challenges and Way forward\r\nWhile significant strides have been made in striving towards attainment SDG 15, there a several challenges which if \r\naddressed will improve country’s performance on targets and indicators and some of them are as follows:\r\ni. Although the government has adopted policies for climate-smart and resilient environmental \r\nmanagement, there is a general lack of implementation and enforcement for compliance to environmental \r\nmanagement plans and regulations. \r\nii. Inadequate planning systems and instruments, imbalance in the distribution of costs and benefits of \r\nwetland conservation, policy conflicts and institutional weakness affect efforts to conserve and protect \r\nwetlands.\r\niii. High mountain wetlands continue to degrade due to uncontrolled livestock grazing and trampling \r\ninfrastructure development, siltation and erosion, encroachment by cultivation and overexploitation of \r\nresources hence their need for their declaration as protected areas to conserve and protect them.\r\n.",

However, there is a \r\nneed for accelerated progress in three targets (15.1, 15.2, and 15.4). Target 15.5, is showing regression, indicating the \r\nneed for additional efforts in this area. Unfortunately, there are currently no measurements available for four targets \r\n(15.3, 15.7, 15.9, and 15.c), highlighting the need for data collection and monitoring to assess progress in these areas.\r\nSDG 15: Life on Land\r\nProtect, Restore and Promote Sustainable Use of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Sustainably Manage \r\nForests, Combat Desertifcation, and Halt and Reverse Land Degradation and Halt Biodiversity Loss.\r\nFiji’s priority targets for SDG 15 are:\r\nTarget 15.1 - By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of \r\nterrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, \r\nwetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international \r\nagreements\r\nTarget 15.2 - By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of \r\nall types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially \r\nincrease afforestation and reforestation globally\r\nTarget 15.3 - By 2030, combat desertifcation, restore degraded land and soil, \r\nincluding land affected by desertifcation, drought and foods, and strive to achieve a \r\nland degradation-neutral world\r\nTarget 15.5 - Take urgent and signifcant action to reduce the degradation of natural \r\nhabitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction \r\nof threatened species\r\nTarget 15.6 - Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefts arising from the \r\nutilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, \r\nas internationally agreed\r\nTarget 15.8 - By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and signifcantly \r\nreduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control \r\nor eradicate the priority species\r\nGoal 15 15.1\r\n15.2\r\n15.3\r\n15.4\r\n15.5\r\n15.6\r\n15.7\r\n15.8\r\nTerrestrial & Freshwater Ecosystems\r\nSustainable Forests Management\r\nDesertification and Land Degradation\r\nConservation of Mountain Ecosystems\r\nLoss of Biodiversity\r\nUtilization of Genetic Resource\r\nProtected Species Trafficking\r\nInvasive Alien Species\r\n15.9 Biodiversity in National & Local Plan\r\n15.a Resources for Biodiversity & Ecosystems\r\n15.b Resources for Forest Management\r\n15.c Protected Species Trafficking (Global)\r\nMaintain\r\nAccelerate\r\nReverse\r\nNot Assessed\n\n87\r\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Conservation\r\nFiji has been a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) since 1993 and ratifed the Cartagena Protocol in \r\n2003, demonstrating its commitment to biodiversity conservation. However, Fiji has not signed the Nagoya Protocol on \r\nAccess and Beneft-sharing or the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress.\r\nIn its 6th National Report to the CBD, Fiji outlined six national targets that guide its commitments and actions toward \r\nachieving both national and global biodiversity targets. These targets include: \r\n• Improving knowledge (SDG Targets 15.1 and 15.2)\r\n• Enhancing protected areas management (15.5)\r\n• Implementing species management strategies (15.5)\r\n• Addressing invasive species management (15.8), creating an enabling environment and mainstreaming biodiversity (15.1 \r\nand 15.2)\r\n• Promoting sustainable use and development (15.2 and 15.6)\r\n44 Fiji’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Fiji: 2020 – 2025 (NBSAP)\r\nAs of 2013, a total of 1,417 species in Fiji were \r\nassessed according to the IUCN Categories and \r\nCriteria for inclusion in the Red List of Threatened \r\nSpecies. These species face various threats, \r\nincluding the introduction of invasive species, \r\nagricultural activities, habitat loss, development \r\nprojects, climate change impacts, overexploitation, \r\nmining operations, wildfres, human disturbance, \r\nand pollution.44\r\nAlthough the NBSAP does not explicitly outline its \r\nlinkages with the SDGs, there are several connections, \r\nparticularly with regards to SDG Targets 15.1, 15.2, \r\n15.5, and 15.8.\r\nProtecting Fiji’s Forests \r\nThere are two types of forest ecosystems in Fiji: wet \r\nforests, which consist of forests that thrive in cooler \r\nregions such as the eastern and central parts of Viti \r\nLevu, and dry littoral forests, which are found mainly \r\nin the western and dry parts of the country.\r\nAddressing Floods and Droughts \r\nThe Ministry of Waterways has developed fve food retention dams in Nadi and is currently working on constructing \r\na food retention dam in Ba. However, more food retention dams need to be developed. These dams have reduced \r\nfooding in communities and prevented waterways from being contaminated, allowing communities to have proper \r\nsanitation during times of heavy downpour. The Ministry is also working on developing a 10-year plan that involves \r\nrelevant line Ministries in various programs to ensure proper utilization and conservation of resources.\r\nNatureFiji-MareqetiViti (NFMV)\r\nNFMV is Fiji’s only domestic NGO dedicated to the \r\nconservation and sustainable management of Fiji’s unique \r\nnatural heritage. Its mission is to enhance biodiversity \r\nand habitat conservation, protect endangered species, \r\nand promote the sustainable use of natural resources in \r\nthe Fiji Islands through collaborative conservation action, \r\nawareness raising, education, research, and biodiversity \r\ninformation exchange. \r\nNFMV’s initiatives include work on the conservation of \r\nthreatened species, establishment of protected areas, \r\nsafeguarding island ecosystems, sustainable management \r\nof Fiji’s forest ecosystems, building a strong conservation \r\nconstituency, and education and communication.\n\n88\r\nAddressing Land Degradation \r\nThe Ministry of Forestry and Fisheries’ Reforestation \r\non Degraded Forest Project (RDF) promotes the \r\nreforestation of degraded forests (see box). \r\nBeneft Sharing \r\nThe barriers for maximizing benefts from genetic \r\nresources have been identifed as: \r\n• Limited scientifc research, technological, and \r\ndevelopment capacity preventing national \r\nstakeholders from adding value to Fiji’s genetic \r\nresources\r\n• Limited capacity to implement and operationalize \r\nABS Agreements and Beneft Sharing mechanisms \r\nwith communities, including insufcient human \r\nresource capacity and piecemeal operation of draft \r\nbio-prospecting policy and guidelines\r\n• Limited national capacity to institutionalize and \r\noperationalize the Nagoya Protocol, and a lack of \r\nunderstanding of ABS and its link to biodiversity \r\nconservation\r\nTackling Invasive Alien Species \r\nInvasive alien species (IAS) are considered the \r\ngreatest threat to biodiversity in Fiji and other \r\nPacifc Islands. Numerous IAS have been introduced \r\nto Fiji, resulting in signifcant impacts on natural \r\nlandscapes and biodiversity. Five of the most serious \r\ninvasive species in Fiji are the Giant Invasive Iguana \r\n(Iguana iguana), the Asian Subterranean Termite \r\n(Coptotermes gestroi), the American Foulbrood \r\ndisease (Paenibacillus larvae), the Varroa mites \r\n(Varroa jacobsoni), and the Taro Beetle (Papuana \r\nuniondis). Additionally, the African Tulip Tree \r\n(Spathodea campanulata), the cane toad (Rhinella \r\nmarina), the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes \r\njavanicus), and the common myna (Acridotheres \r\ntristis) are also invasive species of concern. Rats \r\nand cats are also identifed as problematic invasive \r\nspecies in key biodiversity areas.\r\nProtected Areas\r\nFiji’s forests harbor the majority of the country’s endemic fora and fauna, making them crucial for biodiversity \r\nconservation. The forests are home to at least 2,641 species of plants, with 35% of them being endemic. Additionally, \r\nthere are approximately 5,024 species of insects, although many species remain undiscovered. The forests also \r\nsupport around 164 known species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, of which 28.7% are endemic (NRI \r\nGoF 010a,b; DoF and SPC, 2010).\r\n30 Million Trees in 15 Years (30MT15Y)\r\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Forestry and Fisheries made a \r\ncommitment to plant 30 million trees in the following 15 \r\nyears under the Ministry’s Reforestation on Degraded \r\nForst Project (RDF). This was an initiative of the Ministry’s \r\nReforestation on Degraded Forest Project (RDF) to promote \r\nthe reforestation of degraded forests in Fiji. Up to January \r\n2023, the project had planted almost 17 million trees over \r\nan area of approximately 152 km². Of these, 730,000 trees \r\nwere mangroves. By January, an investment of FJD 4.6 \r\nmillion (USD 2.2 million) had been made into this project. \r\nAt this rate, there is a high probability of surpassing the \r\n30 million trees target well before the 15-year mark. The \r\nMinistry has called for expressions of interest from land￾owning communities who want to participate in this \r\nprogram and reforest their lands.\r\nVillage Will Reforest 350 Hectares of \r\nLand to Fund Own Projects \r\nAn agreement was reached between the Ministry of Forestry \r\nand Fisheries and four landowning units in Cakaudrove, \r\nNorthern Province, for the reforestation of degraded \r\nforests. The plans involve the planting of nearly 97,300 \r\nseedlings in an idle land area spanning 350 hectares. The \r\nfve-year contract will assist the landowners with funding \r\ntheir Village Development Plan. In total, the four landowning \r\nunits will receive FJ $93,247.50 as payment for tasks \r\nranging from poling, line cutting, planting, and weeding. The \r\nincome generated from the project will be used to establish \r\nelectricity power in as many settlements as possible, \r\nestablish fshponds, register youth clubs as cooperatives, \r\nand venture into agroforestry and permaculture.\n\n89\r\nCurrently, Fiji has three protected areas: Sovi Basin, Yadua Taba, and Waisali Rainforest Reserve. Among these, Sovi \r\nBasin in Waimaro, Naitasiri Province, holds signifcant importance as Fiji’s most valuable land ecosystem in terms of \r\nits biological and landscape heritage. Spanning 19,600 hectares, the basin is covered with undisturbed tropical lowland \r\nforest, making it the largest, most diverse, and visually stunning natural forest in Fiji. The exceptional natural and \r\ncultural features of the Sovi Basin present an opportunity for it to become a focal point for heritage-based tourism and \r\nthe development of ecotourism in Fiji.\r\nNature-Based Solutions\r\nNature-based solutions are playing a signifcant role in Fiji’s efforts to build back better in the aftermath of the \r\nCOVID-19 pandemic. One notable example, led by the Ministry of Waterways, is the construction of seawalls using \r\nnatural materials sourced from local communities. Rocks obtained from within the communities are used to build the \r\nseawalls, and vetiver grass is planted along the walls. The roots of the grass interlock with the rocks, providing stability \r\nand reinforcement.\r\nThe design of these seawalls incorporates engineered crevices that create habitats for various plant and animal \r\nspecies, particularly indigenous endemic species. As a result, these seawalls become living ecosystems that support \r\nbiodiversity. Additionally, mangrove systems are planted around the walls, further enhancing the ecological richness \r\nof the area. Alongside their ecological benefts, these seawalls also serve as crucial protective barriers against coastal \r\nerosion and rising sea levels, safeguarding local communities from the loss of lives, property, and livestock.\r\nAn important advantage of these nature-based seawalls is their minimal environmental impact. Unlike traditional \r\nconstruction methods, they do not involve the use of chemicals or generate construction-based waste that could harm \r\nmarine ecosystems and seascapes. \r\nGiant Invasive Iguana\r\nThe introduction of the Giant Invasive Iguana (GII) to Fiji represented the frst established \r\npopulation of this species in the Pacifc, which posed a potential threat to some of the \r\nworld’s most isolated island ecosystems. The GII was initially reported in Fiji on the \r\nisland of Qamea and has since been discovered in Matagi, Laucala, and the ecologically \r\nimportant island of Taveuni. In collaboration with the UNDP and GEF, Fiji has developed an \r\neradication plan that is currently being implemented.",

SDG 16 Indicators Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\r\nThe State is characterized by its high levels of peace, with levels above the national average, being the most \r\npeaceful State in the country; and a population which trusts its institutions. However, despite this, there is room for \r\nimprovement that allows us to strive for a more prosperous future.\r\nIn this area, reinforcement measures are still being implemented to safeguard and improve the safe \r\nenvironment that exists in the State, which is why Yucatan has been investing in surveillance cameras, road arches, \r\ndrones, boats and State-of-the-art surveillance planes. These actions will have a positive impact on the targets for \r\nsafety indicators.\r\nNevertheless, approximately 89.5% of crimes are not reported, which generates a wide margin for impunity, \r\na situation that is not acceptable to the State, so that the State Development Plan 2018-2024 and the medium￾term programs propose policies to reduce impunity through investment in human resources, technology, and \r\nthe strengthening of ties with society.

         "63\r\nSDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies \r\nfor sustainable development, provide access to \r\njustice for all and build effective, accountable and \r\ninclusive institutions at all levels\r\nSituation in Liechtenstein\r\nThe Liechtenstein constitution guarantees comprehensive \r\nprotection of fundamental and civil rights. Liechtenstein is \r\nalso party to the European Convention on Human Rights \r\n(ECHR) as well as the majority of the UN human rights con￾ventions. All people in Liechtenstein enjoy equal access to \r\njustice. They have access to a wide variety of available legal \r\nactions and complaint options against official decisions. \r\nThe state court acts as a constitutional court. It can exam￾ine laws and regulations with regard to their constitutional￾ity and hear individual complaints against violations of con￾stitutionally guaranteed rights. Once all domestic instances \r\nhave been exhausted, the inhabitants of the country may, \r\nas a last resort, lodge an appeal with the European Court of \r\nHuman Rights (ECtHR). Liechtenstein has also recognised \r\nthe right to address individual complaints to the UN Com￾mittees on civil and political rights against torture, racial \r\ndiscrimination, discrimination against women, and for the \r\nrights of the child. \r\nOverall assessment\r\n• Liechtenstein is a well-functioning constitutional state with a stable and inclusive political system.\r\n• Liechtenstein distinguishes itself internationally through an active and consistent commitment to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights, the rule of law, and international law.\r\n• The promotion of criminal accountability, the fight against corruption and money laundering, and the implementation \r\nof all standards in the area of international tax cooperation are amongst Liechtenstein’s priorities in this respect.\r\nThe political system in Liechtenstein is very transparent \r\nand participatory. The National Constitution defines Liech￾tenstein as a constitutional hereditary monarchy on a dem￾ocratic and parliamentary basis. No law can enter into force \r\nwithout the consent of the Reigning Prince and Parliament. \r\nIn addition to electing Parliament every four years, the peo￾ple have numerous effective instruments for political par￾ticipation at their disposal. In the case of legislative propos￾als, the Government conducts a consultation procedure \r\nduring which all interested parties can comment on the \r\nproposal before the matter is referred to Parliament. In or￾der to strengthen policy coherence with regards to sustain￾ability, in 2022 the Government made a commitment to \r\nsubject all new legislative proposals to an SDG analysis. For \r\nexample, the SDGs are an integral part of all consultation \r\nreports as well as reports and motions submitted to Parlia￾ment.\r\nEmergency powers were never enacted in Liechtenstein \r\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Parliament maintained its \n\n64\r\nability to act and the Government kept it regularly informed \r\non the latest situation. It sat regularly, even during the pan￾demic, in compliance with the rules that were in force at the \r\ntime. For example, it adopted a law on accompanying ad￾ministrative and judicial measures related to the coronavi￾rus (COVID-19-VJBG), three packages of comprehensive \r\nand targeted economic support measures, and various sup￾plementary credits. In each session, the Government an￾swered the questions of MPs about the current situation \r\nand the measures taken. These discussions were all lives￾treamed on the internet and the national TV channel. By in￾volving the people’s representatives in this way, the Gov￾ernment’s policies enjoyed broad support during the \r\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\r\nBy gathering 1,000 signatures, voters can choose to have a \r\nreferendum against parliamentary resolutions and call for a \r\nplebiscite. Likewise, the people can launch legal (1,000 sig￾natures) or constitutional (1,500 signatures) initiatives, \r\nwhich must be dealt with by Parliament. If Parliament re￾jects an initiative, a referendum is held on it. \r\nLiechtenstein is a safe country; crime or violence in public \r\nspaces is not an evident problem. Social cohesion and so￾cial peace are guaranteed. The number of violent offences \r\ncommitted ranges from 200 to 250 per 100,000 inhabitants \r\non a long-term average. The clearance rate for criminal of￾fences under the Criminal Code was just under 70% in \r\n2022. Since 2019, the police have also been recording fig￾ures on cybercrime, distinguishing cybercrime in the nar￾rower sense (crimes in which attacks on data or computer \r\nsystems were committed by exploiting information and \r\ncommunication technology) and in the broader sense \r\n(crimes in which information and communication technolo￾gy are used to plan, prepare and carry out the offences). \r\nThe short survey period does not yet allow any conclusions \r\nabout trends regarding these offences.\r\nThere are effective measures to combat and prevent vio￾lence. To combat all forms of violence in public spaces, \r\nthere is a Violence Prevention Commission, which imple￾ments various awareness-raising measures. Of particular \r\nnote are the successful measures by the Commission for \r\nthe Prevention of Extremism and Radicalisation. Since \r\n2011, no incidents of violence motivated by right-wing ex￾tremism have been registered in public. For information on \r\ncombating domestic violence, please refer to the remarks \r\non SDG 5. Of particular note is the 2021 accession to the \r\nCouncil of Europe Convention on preventing and combat￾ing violence against women and domestic violence (Istan￾bul Convention). This led, among other things, to amend￾ments to the Code of Civil Procedure and the \r\nNon-Contentious Proceedings Act to further improve the \r\nprotection of victims and witnesses. Also, a coordination \r\ngroup was created to coordinate, implement, monitor and \r\nevaluate policies and other measures to prevent and com￾bat the forms of violence covered by the Convention.\r\nAs a financial centre, Liechtenstein pursues a clear strate￾gy of transparency and tax cooperation. The Liechtenstein \r\nDeclaration of 2009 and Government Declaration of 2013 \r\nlaid the foundation for an open and internationally oriented \r\nfinancial centre. Through its membership in international \r\norganisations, Liechtenstein has committed itself to the im￾plementation of international standards in the fight against \r\ncorruption and money laundering and undergoes regular \r\nreviews. These include, for example, the evaluation by the \r\nCouncil of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption \r\n(GRECO) or the review under the UN Convention against \r\nCorruption (UNCAC). Liechtenstein is also a member of the \r\nOECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of \r\nInformation for Tax Purposes and the OECD/G20 Inclusive \r\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and consis￾tently implements the standards established by these bod￾ies in the area of tax cooperation. \r\nThe consistent implementation of these standards is also \r\nconfirmed by various reviews. In the 2022 peer review of the \r\nautomatic exchange of information conducted by the OECD’s \r\nGlobal Forum, Liechtenstein achieved a very good result. In \r\naddition, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on \r\nthe Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the \r\nFinancing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL) gave Liechtenstein a \r\nvery good rating in its 5th Country Report in 2022. \r\nThe FAST Initiative (Finance against Slavery and Traffick￾ing) initiated by Liechtenstein, offers close cooperation \r\nwith the financial centre to combat illicit financial flows. \r\nThe initiative brings together the private sector and the \r\nGovernment in a public-private partnership. The Liechten￾stein financial community’s expertise is thus used for a \r\nproject in the area of sustainability goals (see also SDG 8).\n\n65\r\nChallenges\r\nLiechtenstein has a lean, customer-friendly and efficient \r\npublic administration. The Government and its official \r\nagencies are keen to ensure continuous improvement. This \r\nalso includes expanding digital options in order to simplify \r\nadministrative procedures via various channels. This brings \r\nits own challenges, such as maintaining the highest securi￾ty standards and ensuring the digital options are us￾er-friendly and accessible for all sections of the population.\r\nLiechtenstein’s justice system works very well, but there is \r\nroom for improvement in order to continue meeting the \r\nneeds of a modern judiciary that is equipped to cope with \r\nthe country’s needs, both today and tomorrow. \r\nTo ensure social cohesion in the long term a constant com￾mitment is required. In the case of Liechtenstein, there are \r\ntwo areas in particular where challenges have been identi￾fied:\r\n• Increasing digitalisation in communications and, above \r\nall, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, have \r\nonce again led to a growth in extremism. Different forms \r\nof online communication were in great demand in times \r\nof social distancing. This revealed that people can easily \r\nand instantly find other people around the world who \r\nshare their views, opinions and beliefs. These network￾ing opportunities are increasingly being used by groups \r\nthat share misanthropic, anti-democratic opinions or \r\nspread conspiracy theories.\r\n• This has also led to an increase in insulting or discrimi￾natory comments against certain social groups in news￾papers and on internet forums. Problematic content \r\nagainst the Government’s policies during the COVID-19 \r\npandemic was displayed at rallies and – as in other Euro￾pean countries – the measures were presented as a ba￾sic threat to constitutional freedoms and a right of resis￾tance was derived from this. In the medium and \r\nlong-term, the impact of this growing radicalisation re￾mains unclear. Hate speech can have a long-term nega￾tive impact on political discourse as well as on social co￾hesion. \r\nMeasures\r\nThe digitalisation of public services has long been a priori￾ty goal of the Government. SDG 8 deals with the “Digital \r\nAgenda” and various measures that have already been im￾plemented. With regards to transparent institutions, here \r\nare a few examples of measures that are already in place:\r\n• Since 2020, natural persons in Liechtenstein have had \r\nthe option of using a digital identity – the eID – to secure￾ly identify and register for public administration ser￾vices. The eID meets the highest security requirements \r\nwith regards to the level of trust, data security and data \r\nprotection and can now also be used as a means of iden￾tification in other European countries. \r\n• Integrated digital administrative services are also to be \r\ncreated by 2026, so that natural and legal persons only \r\nhave to provide their data and information once (the \r\n“once only” principle). \r\n• Using these digital options requires basic competence in \r\nthe digital sphere, so media literacy plays an important \r\nrole in the 2025+ Education Strategy, which is aimed at \r\nall age groups.\r\nIn order to make the implementation progress of the mea￾sures contained in the government programme transparent \r\nand accessible, the Government launched the website \r\nwww.regierungsprogramm.li in May 2023. It provides in￾formation on the status of the measures (completed/being \r\nimplemented) and is continuously updated. It also explains \r\nhow the measures have been or are being implemented.\r\nWith regards to the justice system, the Government has \r\nproposed measures to further professionalise the judiciary, \r\nincrease the efficiency of the courts and improve the quali￾ty of justice. In future, for example, the courts will have \r\nmore full-time than part-time judges, and specialist panels \r\nwill be set up to deal with foundation law and trust law. The \r\nconsultation process has now been completed and the Gov￾ernment is reviewing the various submissions.\r\nAt international level, Liechtenstein continues its long￾standing commitment to the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights, to the rule of law at the international level, \r\nand to combating impunity for the most serious crimes un￾der international law. Furthermore, Liechtenstein also con￾tributes to achieving SDG target 16.7 by highlighting the \r\nimportance of self-governance and autonomy arrange￾ments in line with the right to self-determination as a means \r\nto prevent and sustainably resolve conflicts.\n\n66\r\nThe UN General Assembly Resolution 76/262, also known \r\nas the “Veto Initiative”, drafted by Liechtenstein, aims to \r\nstrengthen the role of the General Assembly in accordance \r\nwith its mandate under the UN Charter and to act in the \r\nevent of Security Council deadlocks through the use of the \r\nveto. By enhancing the role of the General Assembly, the \r\nveto initiative aims to strengthen inclusive multilateralism \r\nand the international rule of law. Likewise, Liechtenstein \r\ncontinues efforts to promote the ACT Code of Conduct3 to \r\nprevent and end genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes.\r\nLiechtenstein, together with like-minded states, is actively \r\ncalling for the creation of a special international tribunal for \r\nthe crime of aggression.

         "121\r\nSDG 16 Promote peaceful and \r\ninclusive societies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, provide access to \r\njustice for all and build effective \r\nand inclusive institutions with \r\naccountability at all levels\r\nBrief assessment of developments per target \r\n16.1 Violence in Sweden has not decreased. Le￾thal violence in Sweden remains at roughly the \r\nsame levels as in 2017, and the proportion of \r\npeople subjected to assault and threats has \r\nincreased slightly.\r\n16.2 Many children in Sweden still experience phy￾sical and psychological violence and abuse. In \r\nthe latest national survey on violence against \r\nchildren, 14% of children questioned had ex￾perienced physical abuse by a parent at some \r\npoint during their childhood. Few cases of \r\ntrafficking of children are reported, and the \r\nnumber of unreported cases may be high.\r\n16.3 Victims’ propensity to report their victimisa￾tion to the police varies greatly depending on \r\nthe type of crime and the relationship with the \r\nperpetrator. Sexual offences are the least frequ￾ently reported. \r\n16.4 Sweden’s ability to prevent, detect and prosecu￾te illicit financial flows has been significantly \r\nstrengthened since 2017. \r\n16.5 According to the Rule of Law Index 2020, \r\nSweden ranks 4th out of 128 countries in terms \r\nof the lowest level of corruption and has held \r\nthis position since 2017. According to Transpa￾rency International’s corruption index, Sweden \r\nranks third among 180 countries in terms of \r\nthe lowest level.\r\n16.6 Legatum’s Prosperity Index ranks Sweden’s \r\ngovernance as among the most effective in the \r\nworld. \r\n16.7 Political participation in Sweden is internatio￾nally high, both in connection with elections \r\nand in democratic processes between elections. \r\nSwedish citizens also perceive their opportu￾nities for political influence to be high in an \r\ninternational comparison. At the same time, \r\nthere is a relatively large group of the popula￾tion that is far removed from participation and \r\ninvolvement in democracy. Democratic dis￾course is threatened by an increasingly harsh \r\ndebate climate that risks silencing important \r\nvoices. \r\n16.8 Not relevant in a national context.\r\n16.9 The target has been met. \r\n16.10 Freedom of information and the principle of \r\npublic access are constitutionally protected in \r\nSweden. The right of the public and the media \r\nto access public documents may not be restric￾ted based on interests other than those set out \r\nin the Constitution. \r\nOverview\r\nSweden’s fulflment of the goal\r\nSweden has made active efforts to ensure that the \r\ngoal is achieved nationally, in the overall Swedish \r\ncommitment to peace and development in other \r\ncountries, in international development coopera￾tion and in international and multilateral institu￾tions. Citizens in Sweden have a high level of trust \r\nin political and government institutions. Insecuri￾ty has increased slightly, reaching the highest levels \r\nsince records began in 2006. Violence in Sweden, \r\nincluding lethal violence, has not decreased. In a \r\nglobal perspective, however, Sweden continues to \r\nhave very low levels of lethal violence. The objecti￾ve of Sweden’s youth policy states that all young pe￾ople should have the power to shape their lives and \r\ninfluence the development of society. This implies \n\n122 Government Ofces of Sweden\r\nan explicit objective for young people to be invol￾ved in building society, and that young people have \r\nan explicit right to influence. The targets relating to \r\ntransparent and accountable institutions at all levels, \r\nthe provision of legal identity, including birth regis￾tration, and ensuring universal access to informa￾tion and protection of fundamental freedoms in ac￾cordance with national legislation and international \r\nagreements are considered to be met for Sweden. \r\nSweden’s challenges\r\nThe Government’s democracy strategy highlights \r\nthree challenges to democracy in particular: First￾ly, there is democratic exclusion, which means that \r\nmany citizens are far removed from participation \r\nand involvement in democracy. Secondly, democra￾tic discourse is threatened by an increasingly harsh \r\ndebate climate in which democratic voices are si￾lenced. Third, anti-democratic elements have be￾come more visible in society. The judiciary points \r\nout that people have become more reluctant to te￾stify and there is talk of cultures of silence in parts \r\nof the population. The level of recorded cases of le￾thal violence has varied between 68 and 113 cases \r\nper year between 2002 and 2019. In the last five \r\nyears (2015–2019), the number of cases has been \r\nhigher and more consistent than in previous years. \r\nHowever, different types of lethal violence have \r\nevolved in different ways and the increase in recent \r\nyears is due to an increase in lethal violence in cri￾minal settings. The majority of lethal violence oc￾curred against men in 2019 and, with the exception \r\nof individual years, the proportion of men as vic￾tims of crime has increased since 2011. In Swedish \r\nCrime Surveys, a higher proportion of men than \r\nwomen report being threatened, but women were \r\nmore likely than men to report having experien￾ced harassment and sexual violence. Children are \r\nvictims of both psychological and physical violen￾ce and human trafficking in Sweden. Boys are more \r\nlikely to be victims of assault, theft and robbery, \r\nwhile girls are more likely to be victims of sexual \r\noffences and threats, according to surveys of pupils \r\nin grade 9. Pupils born in Sweden with two fo￾reign-born parents are most likely to report being \r\nvictims of crime. However, the highest proportion \r\nof victims of crime is among pupils living in fami￾lies with weaker financial resources. Few cases of \r\ntrafficking offences against children are reported, \r\nand the number of unreported cases may be high.\r\nSweden’s successes\r\nExtensive efforts have been made to reduce crime \r\nand increase security in Sweden. The number of \r\nemployees in the Swedish Police Authority is to in￾crease by 10 000 by 2024 in comparison with 2016, \r\na historic effort. Appropriations for other law en￾forcement agencies have also increased. The Go￾vernment has presented a 34-point programme to \r\ncombat gang crime. covering four areas: law enfor￾cement tools, sanctions, breaking the culture of \r\nsilence and crime prevention. \r\nSweden’s responsibilities and contributions in a \r\nglobal perspective\r\nPeacebuilding, conflict prevention, strengthening \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights, the rule \r\nof law and anti-corruption are clear priorities in \r\nSwedish foreign policy, including in developme￾nt cooperation. Incorporating work on SDG 16 as \r\na key element of foreign and development policy is \r\na prerequisite for working towards a more peace￾ful, equitable and sustainable world in which human \r\nrights are upheld. Sweden’s development coopera￾tion contributes to attainment of SDG 16 through \r\ndirect efforts as well as through its conflict perspec￾tive and a rights-based approach. Sweden works ac￾tively to promote inclusive peace processes and the \r\nrights of vulnerable groups in conflict situations, in \r\nparticular to promote women’s participation based \r\non the Women, Peace and Security agenda. During \r\nthe period, Sweden has been a leader in these issues \r\nand has worked actively on peacebuilding, in parti￾cular as a member of the Peacebuilding Commissi￾on’s Organizational Committee and as chair of its \r\nLiberia Configuration. Sweden is also one of the \r\nlargest donors to the UN Peacebuilding Fund. In \r\n2017, Sweden became a member of the International \r\nDevelopment Law Organization as a further step in \r\npromoting the rule of law and the rules-based glo￾bal order. Sweden prioritises international coope￾ration to prevent and combat organised crime and \r\ncorruption. Sweden therefore supports the work of \r\nthe Council of Europe, the OECD, the United Na￾tions Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and \r\nthe United Nations Commission on Crime Preven￾tion and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ). \r\nImpact on children and young people related \r\nto SDG 16\r\nInvolving young people in community building is \r\nnot just about taking on board young people’s views \r\nand initiatives. Strengthening young people’s op￾portunities to participate in society’s decision-ma-\n\nGovernment Ofces of Sweden 123\r\nking processes increases knowledge of young pe￾ople’s conditions and needs, in turn providing a \r\nbetter basis for decision-making and more effective \r\ndecisions. Voter turnout among young people has \r\nincreased in four consecutive parliamentary elec￾tions and more and more young people feel that \r\nthey can influence political decisions. In 2019, 34% \r\nof young people aged 16–29 thought they had very \r\nor fairly good opportunities to influence political \r\ndecisions at national level. Children in Sweden are \r\nstill experiencing physical and psychological violen￾ce. According to the latest national survey by the \r\nChildren’s Welfare Foundation Sweden on the in￾cidence of violence against children (2016), 14% of \r\nchildren questioned had experienced physical abuse \r\nby a parent at some point during their childhood. \r\n5% had experienced physical abuse many times. \r\n11% of children had been psychologically abused by \r\na parent. Victimisation in the form of bullying has \r\nincreased. The UN Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild has become Swedish law. Safeguarding the \r\nrights of the child and protecting children from all \r\nforms of violence and victimisation both in times of \r\nwar and in peacetime, is fundamental to Sweden’s \r\nnational and international work. During its mem￾bership of the UN Security Council, Sweden wor￾ked actively to strengthen work on children’s rights \r\nin armed conflict, and during Sweden’s presidency \r\nof the Council, a resolution was adopted that high￾lighted the link between safeguarding children’s \r\nrights and conflict prevention. In 2018, Sweden also \r\nhosted the Agenda 2030 for Children: End Violence \r\nSolutions Summit, the first high-level international \r\nconference of the Global Partnership to End Vio￾lence Against Children. Sweden continues to par￾ticipate in the Global Partnership to End Violence \r\nAgainst Children.\r\nKey national policy initiatives in 2017–2020 \r\nIn conjunction with the 100th anniversary of \r\nSwedish democracy and in light of the challenges \r\nfacing democracy, the Government is implementing \r\nan initiative over the period 2018–2021 that aims to \r\nstrengthen the prospects for people to participate \r\nactively in democracy and to improve the resilience \r\nof democracy. \r\nThe Government’s work against gang crime has \r\nbeen intensified through the 34-point programme \r\nto combat gang crime. Increases in funding have \r\nbeen provided to several law enforcement agenci￾es as part of increased efforts in the fight against \r\ncrime. The Government is implementing a crime \r\nprevention initiative, with a national crime preven￾tion programme65 and strengthening support for \r\nand coordination of crime prevention work at na￾tional and regional level. The Government has also \r\nappointed an inquiry to propose ways in which mu￾nicipalities can be given statutory responsibility for \r\ncrime prevention.\r\nMeasures have been taken against drug trafficking \r\nand new tougher penalties have been introduced \r\nfor the possession and smuggling of illegal weapons \r\nand explosives. \r\nMany legislative changes and resource enhance￾ments to competent authorities have increased the \r\neffectiveness of the system to combat money laun￾dering and the financing of terrorism. On 1 Janu￾ary 2018, the Government established the Swedish \r\nCenter for Preventing Violent Extremism, which is \r\ntasked with strengthening and developing preventi￾ve work against violent extremism. Criminal sanc￾tions against companies have been tightened. The \r\nGovernment intends to establish a new agency, the \r\nInstitute for Human Rights. The remit of the Insti￾tute will be to promote the safeguarding of human \r\nrights in Sweden and is proposed to start operating \r\non 1 January 2022.\r\nThe Government has decided on a national action \r\nplan against corruption in public administration. \r\nLegislation on stricter export controls on military \r\nequipment entered into force in 2018.\r\nAs an elected member of the UN Security Coun￾cil in 2017–2018, Sweden worked actively to ensu￾re implementation of the Women, Peace and Secu￾rity agenda, the Youth, Peace and Security, and the \r\nChildren and Armed Conflict agendas. A Swedish \r\nwomen’s mediation network and a support function \r\nfor dialogue and peace processes have been develo￾ped at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as part \r\nof Sweden’s engagement in peace processes. \r\nThe Government also intends to appoint an in￾quiry to propose a strategy aimed at preventing and \r\ncombating violence against children, including ho￾nour-related violence and oppression. In 2019, the \r\nDrive for Democracy was launched, an initiative to \r\nfocus on democracy in foreign policy, aimed at st￾rengthening democracy globally, including by pro￾moting the enjoyment of human rights by all, st￾rengthening respect for the rule of law and effective \r\n65 https://www.government.se/information-material/2017/06/\r\ncombating-crime-together--a-national-crime-prevention￾programme/\n\n124 \r\nand independent institutions, as well as combating \r\ncorruption.\r\nIn July 2017, the Government adopted the action \r\nplan Defending free speech – measures to protect \r\njournalists, elected representatives and artists from \r\nexposure to threats and hatred. The action plan co￾vers three areas of action: raising awareness, sup￾porting the vulnerable and strengthening the judi￾ciary.\r\nFuture measures \r\n• Continue to develop crime prevention work, at \r\nnational, regional and local level.\r\n• Continued participation in international crisis \r\nmanagement operations, both civilian and mi￾litary, and continued work to integrate environ￾mental, climate, conflict and gender perspectives \r\ninto international operations. \r\n• Sweden will continue to be an important and ac￾tive player in the field of conflict prevention and \r\npeacebuilding, dialogue and peace processes, \r\nparticularly in international development coope￾ration and in the UN, EU, World Bank and the \r\nOSCE. \r\n• Sweden will continue to promote democracy, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law, particularly in \r\ninternational development cooperation.\r\n• Within the UN framework, work continues on \r\nimplementing the Sustaining Peace Agenda. The \r\nmain focus will be on ensuring implementation \r\nin the field, where improved cooperation with \r\nstakeholders remains a priority. \r\n• Sweden is also continuing its involvement in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and its contribution \r\nto the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n• Sweden will also pay particular attention to \r\npeacebuilding funding issues. \r\n• Strengthen coherence between national and \r\ninternational aspects and prevent incoherence \r\nbetween different policy areas for the attainment \r\nof SDG 16.",

         "Voluntary National Review for the High Level Political Forum 2017 – Maldives, July 2017\r\n18\r\nGoal 17 – Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for \r\nsustainable development\r\nThe 2030 Agenda can be achieved through continued political support and commitment and \r\nstrong coordination among all stakeholders. This requires effort and commitment by the \r\ngovernment and state agencies, private sector, development partners, local governments, non￾governmental organizations as well as the civil society working in harmony to achieve this \r\nimmense task.\r\nPartnership with the Public Service Media (PSM), knowledge transfer with the NGOs and civil \r\nsociety are some of the ongoing activities geared towards enhancing the partnerships for the goals. \r\nAdditionally, information sharing and awareness sessions have been conducted for the State \r\nOwned Enterprises (SOEs) to encourage their participation and ownership in implementing the \r\nSDGs.\r\nGiven the connectivity challenge that geography presents, the proliferation of Internet and mobile \r\ncellular subscriptions provide an important entry point to reach communities. In fact, mobile tele￾density in the Maldives is among the highest in the world: there are 239 mobile cellular \r\nsubscriptions per 100 people and based on the latest statistic there are nearly 300,000 broadband \r\nsubscribers. The government seeks to capitalize on this high penetration rate to improve service \r\nprovisions in areas of health, education and work with telecom service providers and banks to \r\nintroduce schemes that can enhance financial inclusion for marginalized and remote communities.\r\nWidening the role of private sector in providing services such as education, health, electricity, \r\nwater and sanitation, transportation, communication and technological services and in \r\ninfrastructure development is given importance throughout the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda. Strengthening the laws and regulations to facilitate and widen the private sector \r\ninvestment in such areas should be emphasized. \r\nIt is also important to mobilize additional financial resources through, ODA, concessional loans \r\nand through South-South cooperation initiatives. Related to this, capacity building will feature as \r\na key determinant in the success of implementing the SDGs in the country.\r\nBeing a small island developing State, the country is vulnerable to environmental shocks. The \r\nmain challenge is getting funds required for the implementation of the SDGs and capacity \r\nbuilding to achieve the Goals throughout the implementation process. In addition, due to the \r\npopulation dispersion; additional efforts have to be made to reach everyone leaving no one \r\nbehind. \n\nVoluntary National Review for the High Level Political Forum 2017 – Maldives, July 2017\r\n19\r\nSupported by International Financial Institutions (IFIs), in 2009 the government of Maldives \r\ninitiated an ambitious and transformational reform towards modern taxation. Key to these \r\ninitiatives was the introduction of Business Profit Tax (BPT) and Goods and Services Tax (GST) \r\nin 2011. Furthermore, efforts to strengthen domestic revenue generation through a Green Tax\r\nintroduced in 2015, levied from tourists and tourist facilities and Remittances Tax in 2016\r\nimposed on money transferred out of the Maldives by foreigners employed in the Maldives have \r\nbeen introduced.\r\nh) Thematic analysis\r\nIn the Maldives, the incidences of poverty are considered low with 7.3% of the population below \r\n$1.90 (PPP) a day and an estimated 15% of the population living below the national poverty line. \r\nHowever, the gap between lower income groups and the affluent is widening. There are \r\nconsiderable socio-economic and sociocultural divides between the urban and rural islands, \r\ngender and age groups, with regards to access to basic social services.\r\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of Maldives has increased steadily, from 0.599 in \r\n2000 to 0.701 in 2015, placing it 105th and in the high human development category and above \r\naverage for South Asia. However, once adjusted for inequality, the HDI falls to 0.529 mainly due \r\nto the spatial disparity between the capital, Malé, and the rest of the country. This is exacerbated \r\nby gender disparity where women living in the outer islands are disproportionately affected when \r\nit comes to development outcomes. \r\nWhile gender parity has been achieved in literacy rates, enrolment, and attainments at primary, \r\nsecondary, and tertiary levels, challenges remain, in the areas of women’s political, economic, and \r\nsocial empowerment. Women’s labor force participation is high, but limited to lower echelons of \r\nthe economy. Women are slightly more likely than men to be unemployed. Even though there is \r\nno gender bias in primary and secondary schooling, girls’ access to tertiary and professional \r\neducation is curbed by conservative beliefs about girls’ and women’s mobility and primacy of \r\nhousehold roles over others. \r\nGeographical characteristics of the country are a major challenge for the government in the \r\nprovision of essential services. The population is dispersed over 186 islands with 116 inhabited \r\nislands having populations below 1000. For the government, in addition to the high cost \r\nassociated with service delivery, attracting talented individuals and transporting goods and \r\nservices from one location to another is a huge obstacle. As per the recent census, the key reasons \r\nfor internal migration are for education and employment. To cater to the needs of the population, \r\nthe government is undertaking initiatives to relocate people from smaller islands to regional hubs \r\nto enable them to have better access to healthcare, education and transport facilities. Furthermore, \r\nto bring an end to the difficulties faced in transporting patients between islands, the government of \r\nMaldives has introduced a sea ambulance service.\r\nOne of the biggest developmental projects being carried out in Maldives is the development of \r\nHulhumale', in the greater Male' region. In the mid-1990s, the idea of creating an artificial island \r\nfrom an existing lagoon and transforming it into a futuristic urban city which would accommodate \r\nthe increasing population of the central region was conceptualized. Phase I of Hulhumalé \r\nreclamation, consisting of 188 hectares, began on 16th October 1997. Primary developments in \r\nterms of the required physical and social infrastructure and residential developments were",

         "80\r\nSDG 17: \r\nPartnerships \r\nfor the Goals\n\nWinnipeg and the SDGs: A Voluntary Local Review of Progress 2021 81\r\nAlthough a wide range of groups contribute to achieving the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda, specific \r\norganizations explicitly integrate and work toward localizing the SDGs through policies and partnerships. The \r\nPeg partnership between the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way Winnipeg has \r\nbeen active for over ten years, and Peg indicators were aligned to the SDGs in 2017. Peg hinges on partnerships \r\nwith many groups. For example, Peg’s data providers are a crucial part of the Peg partnership, ranging from \r\nofficial data providers like Statistics Canada, to local data providers such as the Winnipeg Street Census, Harvest \r\nManitoba, and the City of Winnipeg. Peg is funded in part by Canada’s oldest community foundation, The Winnipeg \r\nFoundation, which embraced the idea of Peg assembling one of Canada’s first Voluntary Local Reviews. \r\nOther Winnipeg-based organizations work on research and education initiatives related to the 2030 Agenda. \r\nIn addition to their international development work, the Manitoba Council for International Cooperation (MCIC) \r\neducates Manitobans and engages the public on the SDGs. MCIC facilitates youth and educator engagement to \r\nfoster global residentship through teaching courses related to the SDGs. Winnipeg’s universities work on the SDGs \r\nin many ways. The University of Manitoba is a partner institution of the United Nations Academic Impact and a \r\nhub for SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The University of Manitoba also hosts an SDG student hub to mobilize \r\nstudents and the campus community on the SDGs. The University of Winnipeg works locally and internationally on \r\nvarious SDGs through its research partnerships. \r\nAt the municipal level, OurWinnipeg 2045, the City of Winnipeg’s proposed development plan, has taken great \r\nstrides to align local planning with the 2030 Agenda in setting its vision for the next 25 years. OurWinnipeg 2045 \r\nelevated components of Winnipeg’s Climate Action Plan into the draft and worked closely to align the Draft Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy and Transportation Master Plan with OurWinnipeg 2045 goals, objectives, and policy directions \r\nand therefore the SDGs. OurWinnipeg 2045 acknowledges that achieving the SDGs requires strong partnerships \r\nand extends beyond the reach of any local government, while recognizing the important role municipalities play in \r\nspurring local action. \r\nThe Province acknowledges that for the capital region to achieve its full potential, efforts must be coordinated \r\nand well-planned through effective partnerships. The Winnipeg Metropolitan Region is currently preparing a draft \r\ncapital region development plan called Plan20-50 to guide sustainable regional development throughout Winnipeg \r\nand its surrounding communities. Plan20-50 is a 30-year draft plan for the Winnipeg Metro Region and considers \r\nthe broad principles of the SDGs. \r\nFederally, the Government of Canada adopted the 2030 Agenda in 2015 and works with an extensive range of \r\npartners to develop concrete actions on the SDGs. The Government of Canada released its first Voluntary National \r\nReview in 2018, which highlights the Peg partnership as one Canadian example to guide collective action to achieve \r\ncommunity-level progress on the SDGs. \r\nSDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals",

    "Previously we encountered the situation that bigrams and unigrams consisting of the same words as the bigram recieved very high tf-idf scores, e.g. \"energy\", \"renewable\", and \"renewable energy\". If we keep the Ungrams only, it misses context of phrases like “climate change”. On the other hand, if we keep bigrams only, it fails if words appear separately in different contexts. Thus, we decided to keep both, bigrams and unigrams. (However,  keeping both might slightly increase computational cost.) We  decided to do the following step, to handle this tradeoff.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each entry consists of the SDG number and the corresponding textual description that is highly indicative of its respective SDG. For example, textual description of SDG1 \"No poverty\" is very densly loaded with term like \"poverty\", \"extreme poverty\", \"poor\", \"vulnerable\", etc. These texts will help us identify specific terms that are indicative of each SDG. After preprocessing, each SDG description is processed separately, and a term frequency (TF) dictionary is generated for each SDG, keeping only top 10 most frequent unigrams and bigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the creation of the Description dictionaries, the next step is comparison with dictionaries created earlier using TF-IDF method applied to the corpus of pre-labeled UNDP text. The goal of comparing these two sets of dictionaries is to upweight words that appear in both (UNDP dataset and Descriptions dataset) while maintaining the original frequency for words that appear in only one of them. This is achieved by iterating through both dictionaries and adjusting word importance based on overlap. Words that appear in both dictionaries receive a higher weight factor (multiplying their frequency in the UNDP dataset by (1 + the relative frequency of the word in the Descriptions dataset)), while words exclusive to one dataset retain their original frequency. This step ensures that the most relevant words receive higher importance in subsequent analyses."
